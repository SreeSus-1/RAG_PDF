            "('Lufthansa flies back to profit \\n \\nGerman airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting \\nhuge losses in 2003. \\n \\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros \\n($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. \\nOperating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. \\nLufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand \\nfollowing the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by \\ntroubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs \\nof recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the \\nbrink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 \\ndividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a \\ndividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 \\nresults on 23 March. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWinn-Dixie files for bankruptcy \\n \\nUS supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after \\nsuccumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart. \\n \\nWinn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 \\nprotection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 \\nstores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load \\na number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts \\nof $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest \\ncreditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m. \\n \\nAnalysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers\\' demands and had \\nalso been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month \\nrestructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-\\nexpected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie\\'s slide into \\nbankruptcy was widely expected. The company\\'s new chief executive Peter \\nLynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take \\nthe necessary action to turn itself around. \"This includes achieving \\nsignificant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer \\nservice in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the \\nstores,\" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, \\nsaid Mr Lynch\\'s job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably \\nput off some customers. \"The real big issue is what\\'s going to happen \\nover the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all \\ntheir customers see this in their local newspapers,\" he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS economy still growing says Fed \\n \\nMost areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and \\nearly January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book \\nreport. \\n \\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger \\neconomic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \\n\"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, \\nand festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also \\nimproved, the Fed said. \\n \\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures \\ngenerally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts \\nreported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, \\nbut most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" \\nThe report added that residential real estate activity remained strong \\nand that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \\n\"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, \\ntwo of the nation\\'s strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSaab to build Cadillacs in Sweden \\n \\nGeneral Motors, the world\\'s largest car maker, has confirmed that it will \\nbuild a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in \\nSweden. \\n \\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the \\nmedium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM \\nEurope president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the \\nUS marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac \\nwith a diesel engine. \\n \\nGM\\'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory\\'s \\nclosure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours \\nabout GM\\'s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. \\nBut the group\\'s new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed \\nby the group\\'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have \\nto face a larger proportion of GM\\'s cuts. \\n \\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, \\nsince it reflects Saab\\'s failure to make significant inroads into the \\nlucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently \\nsaid it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment\\'s \\nleaders do not agree. \\n \\nGM\\'s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts \\nto push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the \\nUS, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the \\npresidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for \\nCadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury \\ncar makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed \\ntremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads \\nin Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained \\ntheir stranglehold on the luxury market. \\n \\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-\\nneeded scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than \\n130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers \\nconsider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing \\nmoney fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (Â£104m; 151m \\neuros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced \\nlast year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by \\nbuilding Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs \\non the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share \\nparts. Another way to further reduce Saab\\'s losses could be to shift some \\nof the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted \\nit as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the \\nweak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But \\nnot everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \\n\"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is \\ntoday,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC \\nNews. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said. \\n \\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European \\nconsumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to \\ndeploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting \\npotential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar \\ninitiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers\\' \\nperceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality \\nhad improved in recent years. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBank voted 8-1 for no rate change \\n \\nThe decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month \\nwas passed 8-1 by the Bank of England\\'s rate-setting body, minutes have \\nshown. \\n \\nOne member of the Bank\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - \\nvoted to raise rates to 5%. The news surprised some analysts who had \\nexpected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries \\nover growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to \\nfreeze rates, the minutes showed. The Bank\\'s latest inflation report, \\nreleased last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall \\nwas weaker consumer spending. \\n \\nHowever, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in \\ninterest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up, and \\nthat the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than \\nexpected. \\n \\nThe Bank\\'s minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were \\n\"sufficiently to the downside\" to keep rates on hold at its latest \\nmeeting. However, the minutes added: \"Some members noted that an increase \\nmight be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the \\ncentral projection\". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, \\nsaid he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He \\nsaid the minutes appeared to be \"trying to get the market to focus on the \\npossibility of a rise in rates\". \"If the economy pans out as they expect \\nthen they are probably going to have to hike rates.\" However, he added, \\nany rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC \\nmembers likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer \\nspending before acting. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndustrial revival hope for Japan \\n \\nJapanese industry is growing faster than expected, boosting hopes that \\nthe country\\'s retreat back into recession is over. \\n \\nIndustrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January \\nfrom a month earlier. At the same time, retail sales picked up faster \\nthan at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month \\nhigh, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of \\ncontraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day \\nup 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the \\ndollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan\\'s \\neconomy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% \\ncontraction in the final three months of last year after two previous \\nquarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in \\nthe early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. \\nThe output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic \\nofficials. \"Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious \\nrecession,\" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning \\nthat other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying. \\n \\nWithin the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a \\npullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were \\nkey overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods. \\nWith US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in \\nearly 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also \\none of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as \\nflat-screen TVs in high demand during January. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nKhodorkovsky ally denies charges \\n \\nA close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a \\ncourt that fraud charges levelled against him are \"false\". \\n \\nPlaton Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in \\na case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair \\nclaim they are being punished by the authorities for the political \\nambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were \"absurd \\ncontradictions\" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not \\nsee the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include \\nallegations of tax evasion. \"To my embarrassment, I could not understand \\nthe file of complaints against me,\" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev \\nheaded the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos. \\n \\nMr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail \\nsentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few \\ndays. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court \\nthat he objected to the way that the \"running of a normal business has \\nbeen presented as a work of criminal fiction\". The charges are seen by \\nsupporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian \\nPresident Vladimir Putin to rein in the country\\'s super-rich business \\nleaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn \\n(Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk \\ndivision was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company\\'s effort \\nto gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the \\nsale - were dismissed by a court in Texas. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChina keeps tight rein on credit \\n \\nChina\\'s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on \\ncredit will continue into 2005, state media report. \\n \\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that \\nrapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that \\ntoo much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in \\nChina remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at \\nmore than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept \\ngrowth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s \\nmanufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the \\nfactors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. \\nIn theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist \\nthat the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an \\noverbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a \\nrate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - \\nmeans Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far \\nresisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift \\nthe level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be \\ntaking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down \\nfrom 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail \\nsales are still booming. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nVerizon \\'seals takeover of MCI\\' \\n \\nVerizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth \\n$6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say. \\n \\nThe two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according \\nto news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from \\nQwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-\\ndistance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this \\nyear for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under \\nprevious name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 \\nthat it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. \\n \\nShareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 \\nworkers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently \\non trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come \\nunder suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and \\nExchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it \\nmanipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy. \\n \\nMCI is the US\\'s second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. \\nConsolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the \\npast few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A \\nmerger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms \\ndeal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its \\nformer parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI \\nwould give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI\\'s global network and \\nbusiness-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one \\nunderpinning SBC\\'s AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and \\nhas its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the \\nboard in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and \\nshares. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCrossrail link \\'to get go-ahead\\' \\n \\nThe Â£10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get \\nthe go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday. \\n \\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated Â£7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project \\nand that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin \\nshortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast \\ncross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of \\nCommons on 23 February. \\n \\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We\\'ve always said we \\nare going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this \\nremains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de \\nSouza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm \\nwhether the Treasury was planning to invest Â£7.5bn or when the bill \\nwould go before Parliament. \\n \\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of \\nan election. \\n \\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of \\nLondon, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the \\nCity would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for \\nbusiness travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has \\nthe support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and \\nthe government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it \\nshould be funded. The Mail on Sunday\\'s Financial Mail said the Â£7.5bn of \\nTreasury money was earmarked for spending in Â£2.5bn instalments in 2010, \\n2011 and 2012. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSmall firms \\'hit by rising costs\\' \\n \\nRising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the UK\\'s \\nsmall manufacturers despite a rise in output, business lobby group the \\nCBI says. \\n \\nA CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in \\nseven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing \\nexpenses. The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and \\nretraining is forecast to go up over the next year. However, firms \\ncontinue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery. \\n \\nThe CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the \\nregulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold. \\n\"Smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle,\" said Hugh Morgan \\nWilliams, chair of the CBI\\'s SME Council. \"The manufacturing sector needs \\na period of long-term stability in the economy.\" The CBI found some firms \\nmanaged to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many \\nsaid increases failed to keep up the rise in costs. Of the companies \\nsurveyed, 30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall. The positive balance \\nof plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey. When firms were \\nquestioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - \\nthe highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when \\nlooking ahead to the next three months. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDeutsche Boerse boosts dividend \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its \\nLondon rival, has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%. \\n \\nAnalysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to \\nits bid for the London Stock Exchange. Critics of the takeover have \\ncomplained that the money could be better used by returning cash to \\nshareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 \\nDecember was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; Â£83.3m). Sales climbed to 364.4m \\neuros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros. \\n \\nFrankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered Â£1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn \\neuros) for the London Stock Exchange. Rival pan-European bourse Euronext \\nis working also on a bid. Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would \\nlift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (Â£0.48; $0.98) from 55 \\neuro cents a year earlier. \"There is a whiff of a sweetener in there,\" \\nAnais Faraj, an analyst at Nomura told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \\n\"Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining \\nthat the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in \\ntheir hands, paid out in dividends,\" Mr Faraj continued. Deutsche Boerse \\nis \"trying to buy them off in a sense\", he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapanese growth grinds to a halt \\n \\nGrowth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking \\nrenewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. \\n \\nOutput in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - \\nthe usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed \\nsubdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well \\nshort of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of \\nexpansion. \\n \\nThe economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief \\nspurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was \\ndeflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese \\nshoppers cautious and kept them from spending. \\n \\nThe effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports \\nfor its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the \\ngrowth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US \\nare becoming relatively more expensive. \\n \\nThe performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier \\nin the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the \\nsecond showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% \\nthis time around. \"Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,\" \\nsaid Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \\n\"Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary \\nfactors such as the Olympics. \"The amber light is flashing.\" The \\ngovernment may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it \\nwill have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with \\nJapan\\'s massive public debt. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBrewers\\' profits lose their fizz \\n \\nHeineken and Carlsberg, two of the world\\'s largest brewers, have reported \\nfalling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat. \\n \\nDutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that \\nearnings in 2005 may also slide. Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% \\nfall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both \\nare looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western \\nEuropean markets are largely mature. \\n \\nHeineken\\'s net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; Â£371m) during 2004, \\nfrom 798m euro a year ago. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and \\ncurrency losses. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, \\nwhich has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its \\noperating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken\\'s sales have been \\nimproving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from \\n9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in \\n\"aggressive\" and \"high-impact\" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. \\nHeineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy\\'s stout brands, said it \\nwould also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries. \\n \\nHeineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but \\nwarned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased \\nmarketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit. \\n \\nCarlsberg, the world\\'s fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits \\nfall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been \\naffected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking \\nin pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales \\nincreased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in \\nRussia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, \\nprojecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, it also plans \\nto cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, \\nimported brands. \"We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term \\noutlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, \\nsocial and structural reasons,\" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of \\nCarlsberg. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRussia WTO talks \\'make progress\\' \\n \\nTalks on Russia\\'s proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation \\n(WTO) have been \"making good progress\" say those behind the negotiations. \\n \\nBut the chairman of the working party, Ambassador Stefan Johannesson of \\nIceland, warned that there was \"still a lot of work has to be done\". His \\ncomments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian \\nentry. But he said for Russia to make progress the government must \"renew \\na commitment to democracy and the rule of law\". His comments come three \\ndays before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin. \\n \\nRussia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally \\nbecome a member by early 2006. A decision could be reached in December, \\nwhen the WTO\\'s 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. That \\nwould allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006, if the Hong \\nKong summit gave its approval. While pinpointing several areas in which \\nthere are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with \\nRussia, the US said the meeting was \"much more efficient than we\\'ve seen \\nfor some time\". And Australia said it was \"one of the best (meetings) we \\ncan recall in terms of substance\". Mr Johannesson also said progress \"on \\nthe bilateral market access side is accelerating\". Sticking points to \\nmembership have included limits on foreign ownership in the \\ntelecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues \\nsurrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection. Some WTO members \\nalso dislike Russia\\'s energy price subsidies, which competitors say give \\nRussian businesses an unfair advantage. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndia\\'s rupee hits five-year high \\n \\nIndia\\'s rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) \\nraised the country\\'s foreign currency rating. \\n \\nThe rupee climbed to 43.305 per US dollar on Thursday, up from a close of \\n43.41. The currency has gained almost 1% in the past three sessions. S&P, \\nwhich rates borrowers\\' creditworthiness, lifted India\\'s rating by one \\nnotch to \\'BB+\\'. With Indian assets now seen as less of a gamble, more \\ncash is expected to flow into its markets, buoying the rupee. \\n \\n\"The upgrade is positive and basically people will use it as an excuse to \\ncome back to India,\" said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS. \"Money has \\nmoved out from India in the first two or three weeks of January into \\nother markets like Korea and Thailand and this upgrade should lead to a \\nreversal.\" India\\'s foreign currency rating is now one notch below \\ninvestment grade, which starts at \\'BBB-\\'. The increase has put it on the \\nsame level as Romania, Egypt and El Salvador, and one level below Russia. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDollar drops on reserves concerns \\n \\nThe US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that \\ncentral banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign \\nreserves. \\n \\nComments by South Korea\\'s central bank at the end of last week have \\nsparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea, which has about \\n$200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of \\ncurrencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon \\nthat other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, \\nthe euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. The \\nBritish pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the \\ndollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 \\nyen. \\n \\nAt the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the \\neuro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, \\nstaged something of a recovery. \\n \\nAnalysts, however, pointed to the dollar\\'s inability recently to extend \\nthat rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted \\nthe fact that many of the US\\'s economic problems had not disappeared. The \\nfocus once again has been on the country\\'s massive trade and budget \\ndeficits, with predictions of more dollar weakness to come. \"The comments \\nfrom Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already \\nsoftening,\" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial. On Tuesday, \\ntraders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their \\nbids to buy dollars at the start of the session. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, \\nchief currency strategist at UBS, said that there was a sentiment in the \\nmarket that \"central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying \\neuros\". A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its \\nallure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. \\nCompiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK\\'s Royal \\nBank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were \\nincreasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndia and Russia in energy talks \\n \\nIndia and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part \\nof a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas \\nprojects. \\n \\nOn the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, \\nto be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India\\'s ONGC. The Indian \\nfirm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in \\nassets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% \\nstake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was \\ncontroversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned \\nenergy giant Rosneft. \\n \\nRussian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of \\nunderstanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between \\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman \\nAleksey Miller and India\\'s petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. \\n \\nThe agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining \\nfacilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, \\ngas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across \\nAsia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far \\neast of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects \\nin eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea. \\n \\nIndia is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly \\nliquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a \\nyear. \\n \\nONGC\\'s Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next \\nyear. \"At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" \\nhe told Reuters. \"What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of \\ngas and we have the money. \"The investment may go up to $20bn or more for \\na period of five years or so.\" \\n \\nRussian news agencies reported that India\\'s petroleum minister Mr Aiyar \\nand Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of \\nYugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC\\'s Mr Raha declined to be drawn on \\nhis firm\\'s reported interest in the company. However, he stressed that \\nONGC was not interested in a \\'loan-for-oil deal\\' in connection to \\nYugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China\\'s \\nNational Petroleum Corporation. \"China\\'s problem is it has immediate \\ndemand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. \\nWe would like long-term security through equity participation.\" It is \\nthought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court \\nhas decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing \\na host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay \\na huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any \\nbusiness which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak data buffets French economy \\n \\nA batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French \\neconomy\\'s future prospects. \\n \\nOfficial figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% \\nlast month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October. At \\nthe same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil \\nprices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on \\nconsumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he \\nsaid. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the \\nyear as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand. \\n \\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a \\ntime of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The \\nunemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we \\nhave growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, \\nan economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the \\nwill and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, \\notherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer \\ncontributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to \\nhire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many \\neconomists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing \\nnon-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. \\nThe French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about \\n2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business \\ninvestment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above \\n2%. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBusiness fears over sluggish EU economy \\n \\nAs European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU \\nconstitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to \\nhome - namely how to stay in business. \\n \\nLille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of \\nFrance at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively \\ngrand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, \\nand consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern \\nEnglish towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like \\nnorthern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in \\nlong term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a \\nspecialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. The \\ncompany has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making \\nbolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many \\nof those are being built in Europe these days. \\n \\nDirector Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories \\nin the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while \\nhis key markets are now in China and India. \"In our business the market \\nis absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of \\nbusiness) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we \\nwould need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. It isn\\'t \\njust globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are \\npaid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least \\nthere is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and \\ntextiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough \\nto make up the difference. \\n \\nThat is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says \\nFrederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille. \\n \\n\"In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is \\n15%. They don\\'t see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of \\neuro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. Which is \\nstrange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should \\nbe benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase \\ntrade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been \\nwith the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world\\'s \\nlargest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker \\nHuisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken \\nRussian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now \\nsetting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main \\ncustomers are closer. \\n \\nBoss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of \\norders closer to home. \"In the US growth is something like 6%, in China \\nthey are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,\" he says. \\nMr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old \\ncurrencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country\\'s economic \\nperformance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the \\neconomy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high \\nunemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In \\nBritain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in \\nrecent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone\\'s economy, \\nthis is a major problem. If Germany doesn\\'t once again become the \\npowerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as \\nstrong as it could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border \\nthings are changing. \\n \\nThe Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 \\nstaff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra \\npay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to \\nHungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to \\nincrease productivity \"by nearly 30%\". But Germany needs much more reform \\nif all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The \\nGovernment is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous \\nunemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low \\nskilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the \\nStudy of Labour at Bonn University. \"Labour is too costly in Germany, \\nespecially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we \\ncould solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. The \\nEU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world \\nby 2010. Four years into that process, and the target seems further away \\nthan ever. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nM&S cuts prices by average of 24% \\n \\nMarks & Spencer has cut prices in London and the regions by an average of \\n24%, according to research from a City investment bank. \\n \\nDresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said: \"In spite of the snow in the UK, it \\nstill feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise.\" \\nStuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high. \"We \\nare bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market \\nretailers like Next,\" said M&S. \\n \\nNext is one of M&S\\'s biggest competitors and the move may force it to \\nlower prices. DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could \\nindicate a longer term \"step change in pricing in certain areas\" at M&S. \\n\"Either way, this cannot be good news for M&S\\' margin,\" it added. \"We \\nhave brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part \\nof Stuart Rose\\'s strategy of quality, style -and price,\" said the M&S \\nspokesman. Many analysts believe February is proving to be a difficult \\nmonth for retailers and British Retail Consortium figures, due in a few \\nweeks, are expected to reflect the tough trading environment. Separately, \\ninvestment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of \\n35 M&S goods is now 11% above the high-street average, compared with 43% \\nhigher last year. \\n \\nIt has been a strange week for M&S, which on Tuesday received a statement \\nfrom Philip Green, the billionaire Bhs owner, confirming he was not \\nrebidding for the company. This was followed the same day by Mark \\nPaulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his \\nPaulsmeier Group was interested in M&S. A sudden spike in M&S\\'s share \\nprice followed. However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no \\nevidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. He \\nalso said the Takeover Panel and the UK\\'s financial watchdog the \\nFinancial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning \\nof the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFiat chief takes steering wheel \\n \\nThe chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control \\nof its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around. \\n \\nSergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat \\nAuto, with Mr Demel leaving the company. Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth \\nhead of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss \\nin 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last \\nyear, seeing flat sales. \\n \\nThe car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years \\nand was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The \\nmanagement changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following \\nFiat\\'s resolution of its dispute with General Motors. As part of a major \\nrestructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently \\nowned by Ferrari - within its own operations. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns \\na majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in \\neither 2006 or 2007. \\n \\nMr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was \\nnow the \"principal focus\" of his attention. \"I have made the decision to \\ntake on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the \\ncompany\\'s recovery,\" he said. \"A profound cultural transformation is \\nunderway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more \\nagile and efficient structure,\" he added. \\n \\nAlthough Mr Marchionne does not have a background in the car industry, he \\nhas been playing an increasing role in the group\\'s activities. Last year, \\nhe said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group\\'s \\nrecovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. The car \\nbusiness, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a \\nloss of about 800m euros in 2004. Sales are expected to fall in 2005, \\nFiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental \\ncar market. Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November \\n2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe \\nMorchio. Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the \\ndeath of president Umberto Agnelli. However, this was rejected by the \\nfounding Agnelli family and Mr Morchio subsequently resigned. Earlier \\nthis week, Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance \\nwhich could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright. GM will pay \\nFiat $2bn as part of the settlement. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK \\'risks breaking golden rule\\' \\n \\nThe UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it \\nwants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests. \\n \\nThe rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and \\nnot to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic \\nand Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about \\nÂ£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its \\nplans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the \\ngovernment\\'s current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \\n\"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year \\nearlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal \\ntightening is needed, NIESR said. \\n \\nThe report is the latest to call into question the viability of \\ngovernment spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm \\nErnst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown\\'s \\nforecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. \\n \\nIt claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of \\nthe tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A \\nTreasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on \\ntrack to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle \\nand beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are \\nfully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the \\nNIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. \\n \\nIt said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a \\nlimited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world \\neconomy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product \\n(GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before \\npicking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion \\nuntil 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in \\nJapan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \\n\"is expected to pick up speed\". \\n \\nGrowth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak \\ngrowth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain \\nintact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR \\nsaid, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next \\ntwo years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, \\nand 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR \\nsaid, was the UK\\'s much analysed and fretted over property market. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWorldCom director admits lying \\n \\nThe former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has \\nadmitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board \\nmembers. \\n \\nSpeaking at the trial of his former boss Bernard Ebbers, Scott Sullivan \\nsaid he lied to the board to cover up the hole in WorldCom\\'s finances. Mr \\nEbbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom\\'s \\ncollapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its \\naccounts by $11bn (Â£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty \\nto fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers\\' trial, where he is \\nappearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted \\nthat he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom\\'s finances. \\n \\nIn the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers\\' lawyer Reid Weingarten \\nasked Mr Sullivan: \"If you believe something is in your interest, you are \\nwilling and able to lie to accomplish it, isn\\'t that right?\" \\n \\n\"On that date, yes. I was lying,\" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has \\nsuggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter \\nsentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a \\nsuggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert \\nRoberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. \\nThe trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week. \\n \\nUnder 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has \\npreviously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that \\nfalsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue \\nand earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to \\nstop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted \\nof all the charges he is facing. WorldCom\\'s problems appear to have begun \\nwith the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet \\ncompanies. Prosecutors allege that the company\\'s top executives responded \\nby orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged \\nfrom bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCall centre users \\'lose patience\\' \\n \\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and \\nquicker to hang up, a survey suggests. \\n \\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 \\nseconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the \\nnumber of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \\n\"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' \\nsociety,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned \\nthe survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers \\nsimply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record \\n13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken \\nout of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through \\nmultiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even \\nhigher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible \\nreason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more \\ncustomers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones. \\n \\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a \\nreflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre \\nmay have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible \\nfor credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. \\nProblems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going \\nhand-in-hand with more training, the survey found. \\n \\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average \\ninduction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 \\ndays, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms \\nDiemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor \\ntraining frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, \\ncall centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers \\nthrowing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay \\nfor training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a \\ncustomer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just \\n50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a \\nspecialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well \\nbelow the industry target of an 85% resolution rate. \\n \\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost \\ncountries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont \\nsays. \\n \\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between \\ncall centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing \\ncountries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere \\nif you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. \\nHowever, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven \\nnot just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money \\nis the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. \\nHalf of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills \\nfor the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring \\nare the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey \\nhave no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons \\nfor not making the move: \\n \\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\",  \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad,  \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the \\noffshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of \\nDimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call \\ncentres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences \\nwith call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or \\ndo you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did \\nyour training prepare you for your job? \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nNovartis hits acquisition trail \\n \\nSwiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£3.9bn) of \\npurchases to make its Sandoz unit the world\\'s biggest generic drug \\nproducer. \\n \\nNovartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had \\nbought all of Germany\\'s Hexal. It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal\\'s US \\naffiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. \\nNovartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a \\nyear following the acquisitions. Novartis\\' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss \\nfrancs in early trading. \\n \\nThe deal will see Novartis\\' Sandoz business overtake Israel\\'s Teva \\nPharmaceuticals as the world\\'s biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 \\nfigures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the \\ncompany estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of \\ndepartments, adding that there may be job cuts. \\n \\n\"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is \\nexpected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work \\nforce,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically \\nidentical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as \\nSandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent \\nprotection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to \\npay research and development cost. \\n \\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have \\npredicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However, \\nnot all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. \"This is a very \\nexpensive acquisition,\" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment \\nbank, told Reuters. \"I find it strange that they are making acquisitions \\nin exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nEconomy \\'strong\\' in election year \\n \\nUK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this \\ncould trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. \\n \\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits \\nof a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy \\nHayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week \\n- but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after \\nthe anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a \\nleading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to \\n102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in \\npublic spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. \\n \\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be \\nuncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s \\noutput index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - \\nremained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second \\nquarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent \\ninterest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil \\nprices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen \\ncontinuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from \\n108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the \\ngeneral election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt \\nahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary \\npressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth \\nwill probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see \\nhigher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and \\nservices.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSluggish economy hits German jobs \\n \\nThe number of people out of work in Europe\\'s largest economy has risen \\nfor the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow. \\n \\nGerman unemployment rose 7,000 in November to 4.464 million people, or \\n10.8% of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller \\nrise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation \\nbegan to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still \\nstifling the job market. \"There are clear signs of a revival in domestic \\ndemand,\" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in \\na statement. \"But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still \\ninsufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.\" High oil \\nprices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of \\nexporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the \\nunemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where \\nthe rate is 18.8%. \\n \\nWith unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of \\nChancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the \\nagenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get \\nback to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked \\nanger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, \\nnotably among the country\\'s iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the \\ndispleasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing \\ntakes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called \"one-euro jobs\" \\nwhich top up unemployment benefit. The scheme\\'s formal launch is January, \\nbut hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting \\nthe unemployment statistics, economists said. \"The deterioration of the \\nlabour market does not come as a surprise,\" said Isabelle Kronawitter at \\nHypovereinsbank. \"Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger \\nincrease in the seasonally adjusted numbers.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSales \\'fail to boost High Street\\' \\n \\nThe January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a \\npoor Christmas season, a survey has found. \\n \\nStores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to \\nDecember levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. \\nSales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-\\nlike basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over \\nbuying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin \\nHawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market \\ncontinue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. But \\nclothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than \\nDecember, while department stores also had a good month. \\n \\nIn the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate \\nof -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. \\n\"Following a relatively strong New Year\\'s bank holiday, trading then took \\na downward turn,\" said Mr Hawkins. \"Even extending some promotions and \\ndiscounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt \\ncustomers.\" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst \\nfor 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National \\nStatistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by \\nsome counts were the worst since 1981. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCall to save manufacturing jobs \\n \\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job \\nlosses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies. \\n \\nThe TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed \\nbecause of 105,000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year. It calls \\nfor better pensions, child care provision and decent wages. The 36-page \\nsubmission also urges the government to examine support other European \\ncountries provide to industry. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber \\ncalled for \"a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to \\nthe lives of working people.\" \\n \\n\"Greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering \\nthat childcare will increases the options available to working parents,\" \\nhe said. \"A commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector \\nensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the \\nfrontline services that this country needs.\" He also called for \\n\"practical measures\" to help pensioners, especially women who he said \\n\"are most likely to retire in poverty\". The submission also calls for \\ndecent wages and training for people working in the manufacturing sector. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBat spit drug firm goes to market \\n \\nA German firm whose main product is derived from the saliva of the \\nvampire bat is looking to raise more than 70m euros ($91m; Â£49m) on the \\nstock market. \\n \\nThe firm, Paion, said that it hoped to sell 5 million shares - a third of \\nthe firm - for 11-14 euros a share. Its main drug, desmoteplase, is based \\non a protein in the bat\\'s saliva. The protein stops blood from clotting - \\nwhich helps the bat to drink from its victims, but could also be used to \\nhelp stroke sufferers. The company\\'s shares go on sale later this week, \\nand are scheduled to start trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 10 \\nFebruary. If the final price is at the top of the range, the company \\ncould be valued at as much as 200m euros. The money raised will be spent \\nlargely on developing the company\\'s other drugs, since desmoteplase has \\nalready been licensed to one manufacturer, Forest Laboratories. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFirms pump billions into pensions \\n \\nEmployers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary \\npensions over the past year, research suggests. \\n \\nA survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services\\' (IDS) said employer \\ncontributions had increased from Â£5.5bn to Â£8.2bn a year, a rise of \\n49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension \\ncontributions by 100% or more, IDS said. Many firms are struggling to \\nkeep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased \\nliabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit \\nscheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member \\nis earning when they retire. \\n \\nThe rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to \\nreplace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined \\ncontribution, schemes. These are less risky for employers. Under money \\npurchase schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy \\nan annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on \\nretirement. \\n \\nIDS said there were some schemes in good health. \\n \\nBut, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle \\n\"yawning deficits\". The level of contributions paid by employers has \\nincreased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, \\ncontributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between \\n1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels. Helen \\nSudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in \\ncontributions was \"staggering\" and the highest ever recorded by IDS. \"We \\nhave warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to \\nnew entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from \\npaternalistic provision,\" said Ms Sudell. \"With figures like this there \\ncan be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future \\nbenefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK homes hit Â£3.3 trillion total \\n \\nThe value of the UK\\'s housing stock reached the Â£3.3 trillion mark in \\n2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates. \\n \\nResearch from Halifax, the country\\'s biggest mortgage lender, suggests \\nthe value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily. All \\nregions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade. \\nBut Northern Ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while Scotland saw the \\nsmallest increase of just 112%. \\n \\nThe core retail price index rose by just 28% in the same period, \\nunderlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most \\npeople during the past decade. More than a third of the UK\\'s private \\nhousing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are \\nconcentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax\\'s figures \\nindicate. Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: \"The value of \\nthe private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, \\nby a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households \\nin the UK.\" Halifax\\'s own monthly figures on house sales - issued on \\nThursday - suggest the average price of a British property now stands at \\nÂ£163,748 after a 0.8% rise in January. Housing experts are split on \\nprospects for the market, with some saying price growth will slow but not \\nfall, while others predict a sharp drop in values. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMarket unfazed by Aurora setback \\n \\nAs the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos \\nand interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. \\n \\nThe ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health \\nscares and technical trouble. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of \\nthe huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice \\nchopped off this year\\'s profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, \\nhowever, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent \\nhit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world\\'s biggest \\ninvestment banks had upped its target for Carnival\\'s share price, from \\nÂ£35 to Â£36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT \\nCarnival\\'s shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at \\nÂ£32.26. \\n \\nWhy the mismatch between the public perception and the market\\'s response? \\n\"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche \\nBank\\'s Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the \\ncompany - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very \\ngood at treating these issues as one-off events.\" \\n \\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel \\nin a large Carnival fleet, the UK\\'s P&O Princess group having been merged \\ninto the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival \\nhas a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival \\nhas an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion. \\n \\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business \\nto be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had \\nto give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora \\nhave got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should \\nmitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, \\nRoyal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons \\nare not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup \\nSmith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events \\ntypically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future \\ncruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but \\nfor Carnival customers elsewhere it\\'s unlikely to make too much of a \\nsplash. \\n \\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure \\nof the industry also works in Carnival\\'s favour. In the wake of P&O \\nPrincess\\'s takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a \\nduopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise \\nship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at \\nMerrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your \\noptions are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it \\nlooks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the \\nill-fated Aurora in the future. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGlaxo aims high after profit fall \\n \\nGlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to Â£6.2bn ($11.5bn), \\nbut Europe\\'s biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way. \\n \\nCheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and \\nWellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up \\n1% in 2004. The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver \\nprofits despite the failure of an obesity drug. Chief executive Jean-\\nPierre Garnier said it had been a \"difficult year\". \\n \\nIn early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at \\n1218 pence. Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over Â£1.5bn of lost \\nsales to generics but still managing to grow the business. \"The \\ncontinuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a \\ngood performance in 2005,\" he said. \"2005 will also be an important year \\nin terms of research and development pipeline progress.\" However, the \\nfirm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, \\nknown as \\'771, after disappointing clinical trial results. Glaxo is \\nrelying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, \\ndepression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after \\nseveral disappointing years. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRenault boss hails \\'great year\\' \\n \\nStrong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by \\nmore than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this \\nyear. \\n \\nFrance\\'s second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net \\nprofits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; Â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn \\neuros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good \\nperformance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis \\nSchweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm. \\n \\nRenault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on \\nthe previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with \\nparticularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa. \\n \\nIn total, sales outside western Europe - Renault\\'s core market - rose \\n16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - \\ncontributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman \\nCarlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later \\nthis year. \\n \\nRenault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was \\n\"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will \\nbenefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the \\nroll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected \\noperating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \\n\"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw \\nmaterial prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" \\nthe company said in a statement. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSafety alert as GM recalls cars \\n \\nThe world\\'s biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly \\n200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal \\nregulators. \\n \\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the \\nlargest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles \\n(SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking \\nsystems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 \\nand 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are \\nthe Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC \\nSavana, Sierra and Yukon. \\n \\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack \\nduring normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was \\nopen. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it \\nharder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also \\nrecalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix \\nsedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal \\nmay not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more \\nbraking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, \\nChevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 \\nmodel years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall \\nout in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries \\nrelated to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last \\nmonth that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The \\nworld\\'s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European \\nbusiness, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said \\nhigher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its \\nfinancial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nAsian quake hits European shares \\n \\nShares in Europe\\'s leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the \\nscale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become \\napparent. \\n \\nMore than 23,000 people have been killed following a massive underwater \\nearthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist \\ndestinations. Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value \\nas investors worried about rebuilding costs. But the disaster has little \\nimpact on stock markets in the US and Asia. \\n \\nCurrencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as \\nanalysts warned that economic growth may slow. \"It came at the worst \\npossible time,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. \"The \\nimpact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in \\nThailand.\" Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such \\nas Germany\\'s TUI and Lufthansa and France\\'s Club Mediterranne sliding. \\nInsurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe. \\n \\nShares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers - \\nboth fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in \\nAsia. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. \\n \\nHowever, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market\\'s view \\nthat reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. Worries \\nabout the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, \\nalthough the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. \\nGermany\\'s benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at \\n3.817.69 while France\\'s Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to \\n3.817.69. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be \\nindustry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. \"It\\'s \\nstill too early for concrete damage figures,\" Swiss Re\\'s spokesman \\nFloiran Woest told Associated Press. \"That also has to do with the fact \\nthat the damage is very widely spread geographically.\" \\n \\nThe unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate \\nimpact on US shares, however. The Dow Jones index had risen 20.54 points, \\nor 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more \\nencouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales. In Asian \\nmarkets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and \\nthe cost of repairs. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. The country relies on \\ntourism for about 6% of its total economy. Singapore Airlines dropped \\n2.6%. About 5% of Singapore\\'s annual gross domestic product (GDP) comes \\nfrom tourism. Malaysia\\'s budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort \\noperator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%. \\n \\nTravel companies also took a hit, with Japan\\'s Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% \\nand HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia\\'s largest \\nstock market, Japan\\'s Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. \\nConcerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on \\nthe currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against \\nthe US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai \\nbaht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where \\nmore than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% \\nagainst the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the \\ntotal cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies \\nwould come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil prices reach three-month low \\n \\nOil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month \\nlows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. \\n \\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having \\ndived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light \\ncrude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close \\nsince 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in \\ntwo days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information \\nAdministration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% \\nhigher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. \\nWeak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in \\npushing up oil prices. \"It\\'s amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said \\nRick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also \\nattributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered \\ndemand for heating oil. \\n \\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month \\nhighs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those \\ngains by the end of Thursday. \\n \\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-\\nawaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters \\nover the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. \\nHowever, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a \\ncold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in \\nother parts of the world. \\n \\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has \\nfallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have \\nincreased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has \\nhelped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan \\nin September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from \\nthe energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel \\nwas likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, \\nsome analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec\\'s \\nattitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. \\n \\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are \\nrising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America \\nwould start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. \\nAnalysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue \\nto rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" \\nsaid Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we\\'re \\nheaded to $30-35 but I don\\'t think we\\'re doing that yet. We have a lot of \\nwinter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory \\nServices, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies \\nfor the next three months in the US. . \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMarkets fall on weak dollar fears \\n \\nRising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a \\nfinance ministers\\' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan. \\n \\nThe London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo\\'s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its \\nsteepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about \\nsupporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in \\nJapan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop \\nfunding the US deficit. \\n \\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the \\ndollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors \\nfretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output \\ncut from oil producers\\' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end \\nof the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 \\ncents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 \\ncents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting \\nto talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy. \\n \\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told \\nthe Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he \\nremained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn \\ntrade gap, the red ink spreading across America\\'s public finances is \\nwidely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US \\nTreasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy \\nremained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the \\nmarkets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some \\nhad looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear \\nexchange rates had not been on the agenda. \\n \\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term \\nfix. \\n \\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. \\nIn the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising \\nan $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 \\ntrillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan \\nGreenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. \\nAt present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds \\nto Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the \\nworld\\'s reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the \\ngap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole \\nspends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an \\nauction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that \\ncould turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the \\nvalue of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of \\nthe US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to \\ndollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFive million Germans out of work \\n \\nGermany\\'s unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important \\nlevel of five million last month. \\n \\nOn Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had \\nreached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. \\n\"Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,\" a \\ngovernment minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment \\nhas not been this high in Germany since the 1930s. \\n \\nChanges to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of \\n572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the \\ngovernment. \"With the figures apparently the worst we\\'ve seen in the \\npost-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,\" said \\nChristian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could well put \\nan end to the recent renaissance we\\'ve seen by the SPD [the ruling Social \\nDemocrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-\\nHolstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on \\nthe government\\'s chances there.\" \\n \\nThe opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said \\nthere are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment \\nschemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government \\nreforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under \\nthe government\\'s controversial \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which came into effect \\nat the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and \\nwelfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially \\nclassified as looking for work. The bad winter weather also took its \\ntoll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. \\nAdjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by \\n227,000 in January from December. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman bidder in talks with LSE \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and \\nfriendly\" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said. \\n \\nWerner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the \\nGerman group may raise its bid to Â£1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial \\nÂ£1.3bn offer. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the \\nbid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European \\nbourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based \\nexchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise \\nÂ£1.4bn to fund a bid. \\n \\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE \\nsince its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London \\nexchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to \\nleave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-\\nimproved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s shareholders and \\ncustomers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam \\nand Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement \\non Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but \\nadded that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will \\nbe made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market \\noperator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York \\nStock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the \\nLSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away. \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. \\nAmong sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms \\nFurse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives \\nmarket to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, \\nHans Reckers, a board member of Germany\\'s central bank, the Bundesbank, \\nsaid that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something \\nDeutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of \\nthe Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently \\nin Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of \\nthe banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in \\nFrankfurt\\'s state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is \\nour wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt\\'s standing \\nas the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, \\nits minister for economic affairs added. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nAmex shares up on spin-off news \\n \\nShares in American Express surged more than 8% on Tuesday after it said \\nit was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary. \\n \\nThe US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American \\nExpress Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability. AEFA has \\nmore than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance \\nto 2.5 million customers. Over the years it has delivered poor profits \\nand even some losses. \\n \\n\"This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core \\nbusinesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for \\nquite some time,\" said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain. \\nAnalysts estimate that a stand-alone AEFA could have a market value of \\n$10bn (Â£5.3bn). The unit was acquired by American Express 20 years ago \\nas Investors Diversified Service, of Minneapolis, at a time when firms \\nwere amassing one-stop financial empires. However, the business of \\nselling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nStock market eyes Japan recovery \\n \\nJapanese shares have ended the year at their highest level since 13 July \\namidst hopes of an economic recovery during 2005. \\n \\nThe Nikkei index of leading shares gained 7.6% during the year to close \\nat 11,488.76 points. In 2005 it \"will rise toward 13,000\", predicted \\nMorgan Stanley equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. The optimism in the \\nfinancial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese \\nbusiness community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of \\nJapanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for \\nthe first time since March 2003. \\n \\nSlower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker \\nexports were blamed for the fall in confidence. Despite this, traders \\nexpect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan, which has been \\nclose to sliding into recession in recent months. Structural reform \\nwithin Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector\\'s bad debt \\nproblems should also help, they say. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIraqi voters turn to economic issues \\n \\nBeyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in \\ntatters. \\n \\nA vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has \\nbeen made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an \\nelected government will break the deadlock. \"First rule of law, then the \\neconomy,\" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based \\noil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq \\nin 2003. Mr Hadi\\'s view about what the new government\\'s priorities should \\nbe is shared by many Iraqis. The economy has become the second-most \\ndominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday\\'s election, \\naccording to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who \\nis working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war \\nIraq. \\n \\nJob creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi \\npeople\\'s wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, \\nbut it is clear that the situation is dire. \"Estimates of Iraq\\'s \\nunemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,\" the \\nWashington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in \\nits Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the \\ncountry\\'s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. \\n \\nIraq\\'s infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having \\nbeen made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone \\nnetworks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and \\nthe growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One \\nIraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV \\nadverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down \\nbasic medicines from Baghdad\\'s pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: \"The economy \\nat present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\" \\nAn indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in \\ncontrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks \\noperate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking \\nprinciples. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks \\nhave been buying into the sector. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a \\nmajority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank \\nExport & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq. \\n \\nForeign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. \\nBechtel\\'s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted \\ncontroversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has \\nenjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign \\nfirms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with \\nmany Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for \\nfunctions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms \\nAlexander. \"It is seen as a selling off of Iraq\\'s assets and bringing in \\nmultinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,\" she \\nsays. Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to \\nbacktrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign \\nownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. In the West, it is easy to \\nforget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the \\nmajority of Iraq\\'s citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social \\nsecurity and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that \"people still want \\nthe state to take a leading role in providing these things\", Ms Alexander \\nsays. \\n \\nYet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly \\nwelcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades \\nago. \"I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" Mr Hadi \\nsays. \"Iraq\\'s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of \\neconomic growth.\" \\n \\nMany foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few \\nare actually entering the country in any meaningful way. But there are \\nexceptions. Mr Hadi\\'s Blackwatch is just one of many small operators \\npreparing for a much bigger future. Blackwatch\\'s Baghdad-based affiliate \\nFalcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in \\nKirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the \\nIraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi \\npoints out. \"These guys are trying to work. The Iraqi business people \\nwill do business at all times. \"Life goes on in Iraq, the people take \\nresponsibility, they want to live normal lives.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nPeugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi \\n \\nStruggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to \\nsupply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles \\n(SUV). \\n \\nThe two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect \\nto seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-\\nneeded boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings \\nand poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot\\'s diesel \\nengines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left \\nMitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with \\nPeugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it. \\n \\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine \\nmonths, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales \\nhave slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the \\ncompany had systematically been hiding records of faults and then \\nsecretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has \\nsought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking \\nfor a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; Â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, \\nhalf of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German \\ncarmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided \\nin April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was \\ncelebrated by Mitsubishi\\'s newly-appointed chief executive Takashi \\nNishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to \\nshoulder responsibility for the firm\\'s troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has \\nforecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March \\n2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival \\nNissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It \\nhas been making cars for Nissan since 2003. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChina continues breakneck growth \\n \\nChina\\'s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than \\npredicted and well above 2003\\'s 9.1%. \\n \\nThe news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries \\nto take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and \\nenergy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the \\nrest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that \\nindustrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the \\nimpetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government \\nefforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, \\ndown from 17% the previous year. \\n \\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to \\nconcern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke \\ninflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up \\n21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen \\nin the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. \\nChina raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in \\nnine years - in October 2004. \\n \\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth \\npicture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown \\nin 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. \\n \\nChina\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, \\nbut also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year \\nshowed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus \\ncomes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The \\ngovernment keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - \\nmuch to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs \\nand competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist \\nthey are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \\n\"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs \\ntime,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those \\nwho hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will \\nnot succeed in making a profit.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapan\\'s ageing workforce: built to last \\n \\nIn his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to \\nrun his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And \\nthe 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every \\nday throughout his life. \\n \\nMr Toshitsune is one of Japan\\'s 23,000 centenarians - a club that is \\ngrowing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At his neat \\nOsaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian \\ndaughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist \\nsutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between \\ntasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal \\nis: \"Well, what\\'s most important for me is to be Japan\\'s number one.\" Mr \\nToshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, \\nJapan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to \\nlive until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and \\nEuropeans. \\n \\nOn the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this \\nphenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in \\ntheir seventies. \\n \\n\"I think this is because the food industry and the environment have \\nimproved,\" he remarks. \"On average, we can live longer.\" Whether it\\'s the \\ndiet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly \\ndefined, or just something in the genes, Japan\\'s elderly are remarkable. \\nBut while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren \\nhave huge problems ahead. Japan is the world\\'s least fertile nation with \\nchildbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. \\n \\nBy 2007, Japan\\'s population is expected to peak at 127 million, then \\nshrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 \\nmillion fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have \\nalmost doubled. \\n \\n\"In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will \\nmake up over 30% of the population,\" explains Shigeo Morioka of the \\nInternational Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan\\'s finances \\nstay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit \\nspending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country\\'s \\ngross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised \\ncountries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling \\nbirth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan\\'s welfare \\nstate will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances \\nwill deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly \\nprepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of \\nDeutsche Securities Japan, asks; \"Who\\'s going to fund the pension fund \\nfor the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese \\nworker? \"Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the \\nleaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?\" One \\noption is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from \\nthe Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears \\nrestricted to a limited number of nursing staff. \\n \\nStanding next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York\\'s Statue of \\nLiberty. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island. \\n \\n\"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it\\'s \\nan option that\\'s becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists \\nMr Wood. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, \\nimmigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the Japanese economy, \\nfacing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, \\nhi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash. \\n \\nOf course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is \\ncurrently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar \\nto those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until \\n2030, when today\\'s babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like \\nin Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan - and of course \\nthe European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to \\n420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must \\nre-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America\\'s \\nover 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current \\naccount balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. \\n \\nSome voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the \\nnature of the Japanese labour market. They want a shift towards financial \\nservices, though doubts persist over the country\\'s ability, let alone \\nwillingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"Japan still has problems \\ngetting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business \\nor their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing \\nbusiness overseas,\" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical \\nreforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling \\ndemand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and \\na basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a \\nshrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears \\nthat the world\\'s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. \\nBut none of this is Mr Toshitsune\\'s concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles \\nthat, he feels fine. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK economy facing \\'major risks\\' \\n \\nThe UK manufacturing sector will continue to face \"serious challenges\" \\nover the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said. \\n \\nThe group\\'s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in \\nthe last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. The \\nrise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. However, \\nthe BCC found the whole UK economy still faced \"major risks\" and warned \\nthat growth is set to slow. It recently forecast economic growth will \\nslow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and \\n2006. \\n \\nManufacturers\\' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, \\nthe survey of 5,196 firms found. Employment in manufacturing also fell \\nand job expectations were at their lowest level for a year. \\n \\n\"Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying \\nsigns for manufacturing,\" the BCC said. \"These results reinforce our \\nconcern over the sector\\'s persistent inability to sustain recovery.\" The \\noutlook for the service sector was \"uncertain\" despite an increase in \\nexports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted. \\n \\nThe BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the \\nmanufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the \\nlevels at the start of 2004. The reduced threat of interest rate \\nincreases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. The Bank of \\nEngland raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August \\nlast year. But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of \\nfalling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. \"The pressure on \\ncosts and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat \\nof higher taxes remain serious problems,\" BCC director general David \\nFrost said. \"While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly \\nover the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports \\nwill rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSteady job growth continues in US \\n \\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said \\nthat the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world\\'s biggest \\neconomy. \\n \\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last \\nmonth. That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five \\nyears. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US \\neconomy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady \\ngrowth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in \\nDecember, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if \\nthat figure is to drop. \\n \\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa \\nSecurities. \\n \\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus \\nforecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an \\nincrease in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area \\nof the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication \\nthat the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal \\nReserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The \\nFed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence \\nthe US economic recovery was becoming more robust. \\n \\nJob creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and \\nproved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. \\nWhile demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for \\nsteady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it \\njust keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" \\nin 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, \\neconomists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal \\nReserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A \\nfall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US \\neconomic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest \\nrate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a \\nfall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, \\nwhile noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDutch bank to lay off 2,850 staff \\n \\nABN Amro, the Netherlands\\' largest bank, is to cut 2,850 jobs as a result \\nof falling profits. \\n \\nThe cuts - amounting to 3% of the bank\\'s workforce - will result in a \\none-off charge of 790m euros ($1.1bn). About 1,100 jobs will go in \\ninvestment banking while 1,200 and 550 will go in IT and human resources \\nrespectively. ABN Amro is the third large European bank to announce \\ncutbacks in the past month following Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse \\nGroup. \\n \\nIts profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the \\nUnited States - the bank\\'s largest single market - following recent \\ninterest rate rises. ABN Amro\\'s operations in the Netherlands and the \\nUnited Kingdom will be hardest hit. Jobs will also be lost in the US - \\nwhich accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across \\nits operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. \\n \\nThe restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing \\nadministrative costs and increasing focus on client service. The bank \\nsaid it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but \\noperating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues. ABN \\nAmro currently has more than 100,000 staff. \"To get any profit growth in \\nthe coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes \\ntotal sense,\" Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told \\nBloomberg. Europe\\'s leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment. \\nDeutsche Bank said earlier this month it would reduce its German \\nworkforce by 1,920 while as many as 300 jobs will be lost at Credit \\nSuisse First Boston. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFannie Mae \\'should restate books\\' \\n \\nUS mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that \\nis likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have \\nsaid. \\n \\nThe Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using \\ntechniques that \"did not comply in material respects\" with accounting \\nstandards. Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. \\nThe other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn \\n(Â£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. The SEC\\'s comments are \\nlikely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of \\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \\n \\nThe two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively \\nunderwrite the mortgage market, financing nearly half of all American \\nhouse purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial \\ninstruments. The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked \\nconcerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks \\nover the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight \\n(OFHEO), the industry\\'s main regulator. Having been pricked into action, \\nthe OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year \\nsaid that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly \\nacross quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. The SEC \\nfound similar problems. The watchdog\\'s chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen \\nsaid that \"Fannie Mae\\'s methodology of assessing, measuring and \\ndocumenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported\" \\nby generally accepted accounting principles. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSoaring oil \\'hits world economy\\' \\n \\nThe soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world\\'s \\nmajor economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the \\nOECD. \\n \\nIn its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for \\nthe world\\'s main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in \\n2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the \\nOECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed \\nthe global economy could still regain momentum. \\n \\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% \\nthis year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the \\n12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping \\nto 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. \\nOverall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 \\nmember countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before \\nrecovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to \\nbelieve that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will \\nregain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, \\nthe OECD\\'s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than \\nit was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in \\nlate October. \\n \\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer \\nconfidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by \\nhistorical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil \\nprice does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed \\nwithin the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the \\nOECD, told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was \\nunderway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, \\nwould then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\'s booming \\neconomy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has \\nfaltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD \\nsaid. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery \\nof business investment should continue in North America and start in \\nearnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to \\nbe seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role \\nthrough a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted \\ncurrent depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\'s \\nover-reliance on export-led growth. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nStormy year for property insurers \\n \\nA string of storms, typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most \\nexpensive year on record for property insurers, according to Swiss Re. \\n \\nThe world\\'s second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have \\nseen property claims reach $42bn (Â£21.5bn). \"2004 reinforces the trend \\ntowards higher losses,\" said Swiss Re. Tightly packed populations in the \\nareas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame \\nfor the rise in claims, it said. Some 95% of insurance claims were for \\nnatural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events. \\n \\nThe largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, \\nand Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for \\ndecades plus a major earthquake. \\n \\nEurope suffered fewer natural disasters, but 191 people were killed and \\nmore than 2,000 injured in March after the terrorist attack on train \\nstations in Madrid. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, \\nincluding 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. \\nSwiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters \\naround the world in 2004. Twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in \\nthe catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn \\n(Â£54bn). \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChristmas shoppers flock to tills \\n \\nShops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before \\nChristmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers. \\n \\nA spokesman for Manchester\\'s Trafford Centre said it was \"the biggest \\nChristmas to date\" with sales up 5%. And the Regent Street Association \\nsaid shops in central London were also expecting the \"best Christmas \\never\". That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales \\nin the last couple of weeks. \\n \\nThe Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had \\narrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT. \"We predict that the \\nnext week will continue the same trend,\" she added. \\n \\nIt was a similar story at Bluewater in Kent. Spokesman Alan Jones said he \\nexpected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of Saturday and a \\nfurther 100,000 on Sunday. \"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same \\ntime last year,\" he said. \"We\\'re very busy, it\\'s really strong and people \\nwill be shopping right up until Christmas. \"Over the Christmas period \\nwe\\'re expecting people to spend in excess of Â£200m at the centre.\" \\n \\nOn Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David\\'s Shopping Centre \\nin Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with \\nabout 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. At \\nthe St Enoch\\'s Shopping Centre in Glasgow, more than 140,000 shoppers - \\nan all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by \\nits closing time of 1900 GMT. Senior business manager Jon Walton said: \\n\"It has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed. \"Every week footfall has \\nbeen showing strong growth and at the weekends it has been going mad.\" \\nRegent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: \"The \\nstores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last \\nminute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the \\nweek.\" \\n \\nShe said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the \\ngrowing popularity of internet sales. \"I do think this has had a lot to \\ndo with reports of lower sales figures,\" she said. \"Internet shopping has \\ngone up enormously and not all stores have websites.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDiageo to buy US wine firm \\n \\nDiageo, the world\\'s biggest spirits company, has agreed to buy \\nCalifornian wine company Chalone for $260m (Â£134m) in an all-cash deal. \\n \\nAlthough Diageo\\'s best-known brands include Smirnoff vodka and Guinness \\nstout, it already has a US winemaking arm - Diageo Chateau & Estate \\nWines. Diageo said it expects to get US regulatory approval for the deal \\nduring the first quarter of 2005. It said Chalone would be integrated \\ninto its existing US wine business. \\n \\n\"The US wine market represents a growth opportunity for Diageo, with \\nfavourable demographic and consumption trends,\" said Diageo North America \\npresident Ivan Menezes. In July, Diageo, which is listed on the London \\nStock Exchange, reported an annual turnover of Â£8.89bn, down from \\nÂ£9.28bn a year earlier. It blamed a weaker dollar for its lower \\nturnover.

In addition, the \\nLabor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two \\nprevious months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to \\n198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data \\nhad an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow \\nJones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. \"It \\nlooks like the job situation is improving and that this will support \\nconsumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag \\ncaused by high oil prices this year,\" said economist Gary Thayer of AG \\nEdwards & Sons. \\n \\nOther analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US \\nFederal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a \\npercentage point to 2% when it meets next week. \"It should empower the \\nFed to clearly do something,\" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with \\nEaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the \\nBureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in \\nOctober were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and \\nneighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and \\nSeptember. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before \\nfalling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned \\ntheir attention to other economic factors, such as the US\\'s record trade \\ndeficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately \\ntry to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndy buys into India paper \\n \\nIrish publishing group Independent News & Media is buying up a 26% stake \\nin Indian newspaper company Jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m). \\n \\nJagran publishes India\\'s top-selling daily newspaper, the Hindi-language \\nDainik Jagran, which has been in circulation for 62 years. News of the \\ndeal came as the group announced that its results would meet market \\nforecasts. The company reported strong revenue growth across all its \\nmajor markets. \\n \\nGroup advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year, the group said, \\nwith overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% \\nyear-on-year. This was helped by the positive impact of \"compact\" \\nnewspaper editions in Ireland and the UK, it said. \"2004 has proven to be \\nan important year for Independent News & Media,\" said chief executive Sir \\nAnthony O\\'Reilly. \"Our simple aim at Independent is to be the low cost \\nproducer in every region in which we operate. I am confident that we will \\nshow a meaningful increase in earnings for 2005.\" \\n \\nMeanwhile, the group made no comment about the future of the Independent \\nnewspaper despite recent speculation that Sir Anthony had held talks with \\npotential buyers over a stake in the daily publication. He has \\nconsistently denied suggestions that the Independent and the Independent \\non Sunday are up for sale. Buy it is understood that the recent success \\nof the smaller edition of the Independent, which has pushed circulation \\nup by 20% to 260,000, has prompted interest from industry rivals, with \\nDaily Mail & General Trust tipped as the most likely suitor.

The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the \\nsixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown \\noccurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but \\nthis time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman \\nIan Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase \\ninterest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to \\nconsolidate.\" \\n \\nThe figures support recent data from the government and other bodies \\nwhich all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the \\nCouncil of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building \\nSocieties Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures \\nwere published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the \\naverage asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in \\nNovember to Â£189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South \\nsaw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than \\nthe national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward \\npath, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to \\ndent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at \\ntheir most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised \\ndespite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year \\nand I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added. \\nLooking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the \\nmarket picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over \\nthe coming 12 months. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBanker loses sexism claim \\n \\nA former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her \\nÂ£7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank. \\n \\nAn employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba\\'s allegations of \\nsexual discrimination and unequal pay. But the 42-year-old won her claim \\nof unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her \\npartial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about Â£55,000, a \\ntiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be \\nassessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an \\nemployment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test \\ncase. \\n \\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed \\nbecause, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait \\nto see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the \\norganisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill\\'s private client \\nbusiness in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. \\n \\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very \\ndisappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill\\'s procedures \\nwithin the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba\\'s claim of \\nvictimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in \\nconnection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish \\nculture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about \\nperformance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was \\nremoved by the very same person who had promoted her into the position \\nand who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated \\nto creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity \\nto advance based on their skills and hard work.\" \\n \\nBased in London\\'s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill\\'s \\nglobal private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of \\nMerrill\\'s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her \\nshe had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made \\nredundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba\\'s claims and said she was \\nremoved from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was \\nsuffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms \\nVillalba\\'s division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms \\nVillalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRover deal \\'may cost 2,000 jobs\\' \\n \\nSome 2,000 jobs at MG Rover\\'s Midlands plant may be cut if investment in \\nthe firm by a Chinese car maker goes ahead, the Financial Times has \\nreported. \\n \\nShanghai Automotive Industry Corp plans to shift production of the Rover \\n25 to China and export it to the UK, sources close to the negotiations \\ntell the FT. But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were \\n\"speculation\". A tie-up, seen as Rover\\'s last chance to save its \\nLongbridge plant, has been pushed by UK Chancellor Gordon Brown.

But now its banks have agreed to \\nextend its credit facilities until March 2006. \\n \\nThe company also said it had agreed terms over the completion of 14 of \\nits biggest construction projects under the government\\'s Private Finance \\nInitiative (PFI). \\n \\nJarvis wants to scale back the division, which has proved too costly and \\nhas been blamed for many of its problems. Instead, it plans to focus on \\nUK rail renewal, roads and plant hire work. Madrid-based Ferrovial \\nalready holds a 33% stake in Tube Lines, which maintains the Jubilee, \\nNorthern and Piccadilly lines. The Spanish group has been keen to snap up \\nmore UK infrastructure assets, having bought Amey in 2003. Jarvis said \\nthe sale, which raked in more than the Â£100m analysts had expected, \\nwould \"substantially\" enhance its financial position. \"I am now confident \\nthat we can now move forward in 2005 towards rebuilding Jarvis and return \\nit to growth as a profitable business,\" said chief executive Alan Lovell. \\nShares in Jarvis were up more than 16% to 18 pence by the close of trade \\non Friday. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBattered dollar hits another low \\n \\nThe dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data \\nfuelled fresh concerns about the US economy. \\n \\nThe greenback hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to \\n$1.3509. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded \\nabout $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and \\nbudget deficits. Meanwhile, France\\'s finance minister has said the world \\nfaced \"economic catastrophe\" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on \\ncurrency controls. Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue \\nat the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European \\nand Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the \\ndollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to \\nhurt their export-driven economies. \"It\\'s absolutely essential that at \\nthe meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need \\ncoordinated management at the world level,\" said Mr Gaymard. \\n \\nThursday\\'s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing \\nyear-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - \\nwith some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer \\nactivity. \\n \\nCommerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two \\nthirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The figure was \\nweaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The \\nofficial US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market \\nobservers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost \\nto its exporters. \\n \\nThe US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which \\nhave publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \\n\"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002. The US says it will let \\nmarket forces determine the dollar\\'s strength rather than intervene \\ndirectly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his \\naim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the \\ncurrency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had \\nexacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend \\nremains downwards. The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year \\nand analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, \\nin 2005. \"I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see \\nthat it\\'s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, \\nfinishing the year around $1.40,\" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist \\nwith HSBC in London. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDisaster claims \\'less than $10bn\\' \\n \\nInsurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an \\nearthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern \\nAsia. \\n \\nMunich Re and Swiss Re, the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers, have said \\nexposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are \\nlikely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those \\naffected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re has said total \\nclaims are likely to be less than $10bn (Â£5.17bn). Swiss Re believes \\nthat the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in \\ndouble-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the \\nworld\\'s largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than \\n100m euros (Â£70m; $136m). \\n \\nAt least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, \\nIndia and Thailand among the worst hit. The region\\'s resorts and Western \\ntourists are expected to be among the main claimants. \\n \\nLloyds of London told the Financial Times it expected its exposure to be \\nlimited to \"holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and \\nmarine risks\". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe\\'s fifth-largest \\nreinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the \\nlow double-digit millions of euros. The company has paid out about 300 \\nmillion euros (Â£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four \\nmajor hurricanes in the US. \\n \\nBut insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the \\ndamage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming \\nthrough. \\n \\n\"So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,\" said Serge \\nTroeber, deputy head of Swiss Re\\'s natural disasters department. \"You \\nneed very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike the \\nhurricanes, you can\\'t just run a model.\" He anticipated that his own \\ncompany\\'s total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, \\nwhich the company put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said \\nit did not know yet what its exposure would be. However, it said the \\ntidal waves were unlikely to have a \"significant\" impact on its business. \\nZurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. \\n \\nThe impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, \\nanalysts said. \\n \\nMost US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that \\ndo, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special \\ncatastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the \"billions of \\ndollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, \\nthe Maldive Islands and Malaysia,\" said Prudential Equity Group insurance \\nanalyst Jay Gelb. \"US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no \\nexposure. It\\'s more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] \\nmight have some exposure,\" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG \\nEdwards & Co. \\n \\nMany of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the \\nMaldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said \\na US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the \\namount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri \\nLanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to \\nthe cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch. \\n \\nMitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in \\n1998. But the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is \\nincalculable. \"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the \\nnameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped \\nout. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,\" said Jan Egeland, \\nhead of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \\nTourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a \\nfinancial impact too. The Association of British insurers warned that \\ntravel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. It said \\nloss of possessions will usually be covered, but the Association stressed \\nthe importance of checking the wording of travel policies. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDollar hits new low versus euro \\n \\nThe US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to \\na new low against the euro. \\n \\nInvestors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do \\nanything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a \\ndeclining dollar. The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit \\nand analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a \\ndepreciation of the dollar. They have predicted that the dollar is likely \\nto fall even further. \\n \\nThe US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday. \\nThis compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in New York on \\nFriday, which was then a record low. \\n \\nThe dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about \\n$1.20 against the euro. It has lost 7% this year, while against the \\nJapanese yen it is down 3.2%. Traders said that thin trading levels had \\namplified Monday\\'s move. \"It\\'s not going to take much to push [the \\ndollar] one way or the other,\" said Grant Wilson of Mellon Bank. \\nLiquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the \\nmarket - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIsraeli economy picking up pace \\n \\nIsrael\\'s economy is forecast to grow by 4.2% in 2004 as it continues to \\nemerge from a three-year recession. \\n \\nThe main driver of the faster-than-expected expansion has been exports, \\nwith tourism seeing a strong rebound, the statistical office said. The \\neconomy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli \\nviolence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products. The \\noutlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said. \\n \\nMany companies have focused on cost cutting and greater efficiency, while \\nthe government has been trying to trim public spending and push through \\nreforms. The growth figures come about despite a strike earlier this year \\nby about 400,000 public sector worker which closed banks, hospitals, \\npostal services and transport facilities. Growth did slow in the second \\nhalf, but only slightly. Exports for the year rose by 14%, while tourist \\nrevenues were up by 30%. Imports gained by 13%, signalling that domestic \\ndemand has picked up again. In 2003, imports declined by 1.8%. In 2003, \\nthe economy expanded by 1.3% \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS gives foreign firms extra time \\n \\nForeign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate \\ngovernance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog. \\n \\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get \\nin line with the rules until 15 July 2006. Many foreign firms had \\nprotested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are \\nthe result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after \\ncorporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox \\nAct, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that \\ntheir financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already \\nhave to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms \\nwhich list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the \\nmiddle of this year. \\n \\nOver the past few months, delegations of European and other business \\nleaders have been heading to the SEC\\'s Washington DC headquarters to \\nprotest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short \\nand some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose \\nto let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. \\nThe latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just \\nbefore the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this \\nsignifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby \\nJones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and \\nto many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation \\nreally means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC \\nsaid it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were \\nalready working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their \\nhome countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new \\ninternational financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t \\nunderestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension \\nwill provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look \\nat their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief \\naccountant. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman jobless rate at new record \\n \\nMore than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures \\nshow. \\n \\nThe figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age \\npopulation, is the highest jobless rate in Europe\\'s biggest economy since \\nthe 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany\\'s panel of government \\neconomic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on \\nGerman TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel\\'s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too \\noptimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005. \\n \\nThe German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of \\njoblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \\n\"Hartz-IV\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits \\nand push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily \\nsubsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the \\npressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day \\nin advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor \\nGerhard Schroeder\\'s Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr \\nSchroeder had originally come into office promising to halve \\nunemployment. \\n \\nStill, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The \\nsoaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology \\nwhich pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. \\nAdjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 \\nmillion people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous \\nmonth. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the \\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people \\nout of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 \\nnew net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people \\nemployed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone \\nwho in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could \\ntake up immediately. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRecord year for Chilean copper \\n \\nChile\\'s copper industry has registered record earnings of $14.2bn in \\n2004, the governmental Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) has reported. \\n \\nStrong demand from China\\'s fast-growing economy and high prices have \\nfuelled production, said Cochilco vice president Patricio Cartagena. He \\nadded that the boom has allowed the government to collect $950m in taxes. \\nMr Cartagena said the industry expects to see investment worth $10bn over \\nthe next three years. \\n \\n\"With these investments, clearly we are going to continue being the \\nprinciple actor in the mining of copper. It\\'s a consolidation of the \\nindustry with new projects and expansions that will support greater \\nproduction.\" Australia\\'s BHP Billiton - which operates La Escondida, the \\nworld\\'s largest open pit copper mine - is planning to invest $1.9bn \\nbetween now and 2007, while state-owned Codelco will spend about $1bn on \\nvarious projects. Chile, the biggest copper producer in the world, is now \\nanalyzing ways of to keep prices stable at their current high levels, \\nwithout killing off demand or leading customers to look for substitutes \\nfor copper. The copper price reached a 16-year high in October 2004. \\nProduction in Chile is expected rise 3.5% in 2005 to 5.5 million tonnes, \\nsaid Mr Cartagena. Cochilco expects for 2005 a slight reduction on copper \\nprices and forecasts export earnings will fall 10.7%. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS consumer confidence up \\n \\nConsumers\\' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest \\nfor five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey \\nsays. \\n \\nThe feel-good factor among US consumers rose in December for the first \\ntime since July according to new data. The Conference Board survey of \\n5,000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and \\neconomic growth. US retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 \\ndays after a slow start to the crucial festive season. \\n \\nAccording to figures also released on Tuesday, sales in shopping malls in \\nthe week to 25 December were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last \\nminute rush. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December \\nsales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of \\nstrong post-Christmas sales. \\n \\nIt is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month. \\nConsumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator \\nbecause consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic \\nactivity in the United States. \"The continuing economic expansion, \\ncombined with job growth, has consumers ending this year on a high note,\" \\nsaid Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board\\'s consumer research \\ncentre. \"And consumers\\' outlook suggests that the economy will continue \\nto expand in the first half of next year.\" The overall US economy has \\nperformed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to \\nincrease interest rates five times since June. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCash gives way to flexible friend \\n \\nSpending on credit and debit cards has overtaken cash spending in the UK \\nfor the first time. \\n \\nThe moment that plastic finally toppled cash happened at 10.38am on \\nWednesday, according to the Association for Payment Clearing Services \\n(Apacs) Apacs chose school teacher Helen Carroll, from Portsmouth, to \\nmake the historic transaction. The switch over took place as she paid for \\nher groceries in the supermarket chain Tesco\\'s Cromwell Road branch. \\n \\nMrs Carroll was born in the same year that plastic cards first appeared \\nin the UK. \"I pay for most things with my debit card, with occasional \\npurchases on one of my credit cards,\" said Mrs Carroll, who teaches at \\nPeel Common Infants School in Gosport. \\n \\nSpending patterns for the year and estimates for December led Apacs to \\nconclude that 10.38am was the time that plastic would finally rule the \\nroost. Shoppers in the UK are expected to put Â£269bn on plastic cards \\nduring the whole of 2004, compared with Â£268bn paid with cash, Apacs \\nsaid. When the first plastic cards appeared in the UK in June 1966, \\nissued by Barclaycard, but only a handful of retailers accepted them and \\nvery few customers held them. \"But in less than 40 years, plastic has \\nbecome our most popular way to pay, due to the added security and \\nflexibility it offers,\" said Apacs spokeswoman Jemma Smith. \"The key \\ndriver has been the introduction of debit cards, which now account for \\ntwo-thirds of plastic card transactions and are used by millions of us \\nevery day.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapanese mogul arrested for fraud \\n \\nOne of Japan\\'s best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges \\nof falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the \\nfalse data. \\n \\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world\\'s richest man and ran a \\nbusiness spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His \\nis the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over \\nbusiness scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince \\nhotels in Tokyo. \\n \\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large \\nproperty business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s \\nmost powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the \\ncountry\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring \\nthe Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced \\nto resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being \\naccused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, \\none of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed \\ncompany can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr \\nTsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence \\nbecause he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than \\nthis amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, \\nits share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid. \\n \\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top \\nexecutives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business \\npractices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His \\ndetermination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in \\nhis childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his \\nmoney buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has \\ndescribed the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I \\ndined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly \\nmagazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told \\nme fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, \\nsaying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at \\nsome other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from \\nMitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their \\nvehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged \\nwith concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil rebounds from weather effect \\n \\nOil prices recovered in Asian trade on Tuesday, after falling in New York \\non milder winter weather across the US. \\n \\nWith winter temperatures staying relatively high in the northern US, a \\nbarrel of light crude ended Monday down $1.33 to $42.12. However crude \\nprices have rebounded in Asia, rising to $42.30 a barrel for February \\ndelivery. In London, trading of Brent crude was suspended for a public \\nholiday, but the price fell to $39.20 in the Far East. \\n \\nWith milder temperatures expected to continue in the northern parts of \\nthe US over the next few days at least, analysts have said the price of \\noil may fall further - even if the decline was only temporary. \"Weather \\nhas been the Achilles\\' heel of this market,\" said ABN AMRO analyst John \\nBrady. \"But it is winter in the northeast. Eventually we\\'ll get another \\ncold blast.\" Despite a fall of more than $12 a barrel from the record \\nhighs reached in late October, the price of crude oil remains almost 30% \\nhigher than year-ago levels. Prices rose last week after militant attacks \\nin Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, briefly renewed fears that the \\nsupply chain might be broken in the world\\'s leading crude exporter. \"The \\nmarket was panicked but fears essentially evaporated... since there was \\nno follow-up,\" said Deborah White, senior economist for energy at SG \\nSecurities in Paris. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak end-of-year sales hit Next \\n \\nNext has said its annual profit will be Â£5m lower than previously \\nexpected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. \\n \\n\"Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our \\nexpectations,\" the company said. The High Street retailer said it now \\nexpected to report annual profits of between Â£415m and Â£425m ($779m-\\n798m). Next\\'s shares fell more than 3% following the release of the \\ntrading statement. \\n \\nNext chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were \\n\"below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be\", but said sales \\nshould still top analyst expectations. \\n \\nAmong areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear \\nranges were \"a little bit too similar to the previous year\". Mr Wolfson \\nalso said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were \"more to do with \\nthe fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) \\ndemand wasn\\'t there for the stock\". Next\\'s like-for-like store sales in \\nthe five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year \\nearlier. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected \\nby new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next \\nstores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was \\n0.5%. \\n \\nOverall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up \\n12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise \\n13.4% during the five-month period. \"In terms of all the worries about \\ntheir trading pre-Christmas, it\\'s a result,\" said Nick Bubb, an analyst \\nat Evolution Securities. \"Profits of around Â£420m would be well within \\nthe comfort zone.\" However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told \\nReuters the seasonal sales performance was \"not what people had hoped \\nfor\". \"Christmas has been tough for the whole sector, and this is one of \\nthe best retailers,\" he said.

The sugar group had been absent from the FTSE 100 for \\nseven years until Mr Ferguson helped it return to growth. Tate\\'s shares \\nhave leapt 55% this year, boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of \\nits artificial sweeteners. \\n \\n\"After years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the \\nFTSE 100, one of Britain\\'s venerable manufacturers has returned to the \\nvaunted index,\" Forbes said. Mr Ferguson took the helm at the company in \\n2003, after spending most of his career at consumer goods giant Unilever. \\nTate & Lyle, which was an original member of the historic FT-30 index in \\n1935, operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production \\nfacilities in 28 countries.

Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in \\nLondon, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is \\ndue to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to \\nraise Â£1.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is \\nscheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche \\nBoerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third \\nmeeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December. \\n \\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse\\'s proposed Â£1.3bn offer in December, \\nsaying it undervalued the business. \\n \\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \\n\"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s \\nshareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the \\nParis, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the \\nLSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be \\nsolely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage \\nthat any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the \\nbiggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the \\nworld after the New York Stock Exchange. \\n \\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a \\ncharm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German \\nsuitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of \\nLondon and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the \\nDeutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based \\nClearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities \\ntransactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling \\nblock to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche \\nBoerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult \\nfor them to negotiate for lower transaction fees. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nHigh fuel prices hit BA\\'s profits \\n \\nBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. \\n \\nReporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the \\nairline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a \\nyear earlier. Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \\n\"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. \\nBA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it \\nexpects a rise in full-year revenues. \\n \\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year \\nintroduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. \\n \\nIn October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul \\nflights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a \\nleg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein \\nsays BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be \\nway short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. \\nTurnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from \\na rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March \\n2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were \\nexpected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of \\ncompetition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be \\nbetter than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total \\nrevenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to \\n3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had \\npreviously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. \\n \\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. \\nAviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest \\nquarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue \\nside and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo \\ndevelopment, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are \\nvery strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United \\nStates, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \\n\"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst \\ncontinuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, \\nwe have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will \\nstart further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares \\nclosed up four pence at 274.5 pence. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS interest rate rise expected \\n \\nUS interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June \\nfollowing the US Federal Reserve\\'s latest rate-setting meeting later on \\nTuesday. \\n \\nBorrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to \\n2.25%. The move comes as a recovery in the US economy, the world\\'s \\nbiggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. The dollar\\'s \\nrecord-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with \\nhigh oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. \"We are \\nseeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,\" said Ken Kim, an \\nanalyst at Stone & McCarthy Research. \"It\\'s not a risk, it\\'s actually \\nhappening.\" Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further. \\n \\nThe Fed has said that it will move in a \"measured\" way to combat price \\ngrowth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted \\nby sluggish US and global growth. \\n \\nWith the economic picture now looking more rosy, the Fed has implemented \\nquarter percentage point rises in June, August, September and November. \\nAlthough the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three \\nmonths to September, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move \\ntoo aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery\\'s sails. Earlier \\nthis month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer \\nconfidence is subdued. \"I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of \\nflexibility,\" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. \"While \\ninflation has moved up, it hasn\\'t moved up a lot.\" \"If economic growth \\nshould subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in \\nits tightening. \"But if economic growth picked up and caused core \\ninflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be \\nprepared to tighten more quickly as well.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak dollar trims Cadbury profits \\n \\nThe world\\'s biggest confectionery firm, Cadbury Schweppes, has reported a \\nmodest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its \\nresults. \\n \\nUnderlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to Â£933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would \\nhave been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. The owner of \\nbrands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% \\nof its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit \\nits targets for 2005. \"While the external commercial environment remains \\ncompetitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and \\npeople to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,\" said chief executive \\nTodd Stitzer. \\n \\nThe modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company \\nsaid in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in \\nEurope. \\n \\nCadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was \\nhelped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls \\n- which enjoyed a \"successful\" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. \\nDrinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, \\nled by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. \\nCadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved \\nÂ£75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to Â£100m since the scheme \\nbegan in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group\\'s \\nfactories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more \\nthan 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nContinental \\'may run out of cash\\' \\n \\nShares in Continental Airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it \\ncould run out of cash. \\n \\nIn a filing to US regulators the airline warned of \"inadequate liquidity\" \\nif it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. \\nContinental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to \\nlose \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in 2005 in current market \\nconditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its \\nfleet, the group said. Shares in the fifth biggest US carrier had fallen \\n6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. \"Without the reduction in wage \\nand benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we \\nbelieve that our ability to raise additional money through financings \\nwould be uncertain,\" Continental said in its filing to the US Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (SEC). \\n \\nAirlines have faced tough conditions in recent years, amid terrorism \\nfears since the 11 September World Trade Centre attack in 2001. But \\ndespite passengers returning to the skies, record-high fuel costs and \\nfare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their \\ntoll. Houston-based Continental now has debt and pension payments of \\nnearly $984m which it must pay off this year. The company has been \\nworking to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in \\ncosts without cutting jobs. Two weeks\\' ago the group also announced it \\nwould be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes \\nto wage and benefits for most of its US-based management and clerical \\nstaff. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMixed Christmas for US retailers \\n \\nUS retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers \\nfaring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales. \\n \\nUpscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher \\nthan during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold \\nwell, with sales jumping 28% at young women\\'s clothing retailer Bebe \\nStores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its \\nsales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December \\nsales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier. \\n \\nCustomers at the world\\'s biggest retailer are generally seen to be the \\nmost vulnerable to America\\'s economic woes. \\n \\nCommentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over \\njob security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in \\nspending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart \\nfaced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the \\nfestive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best \\nbargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across \\nthe sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual \\nretail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better \\nthan expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst \\nat research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that \\nhave been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be \\ncontinuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the \\nlast several months, December was a good month.\" Overall, December sales \\nare forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen \\na year earlier. \\n \\nOne discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, \\nwhich continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-\\nexpected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and \\nvaried. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales \\nsink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. \\nLeading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of \\na 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas \\nperiod. Accessory vendor Claire\\'s Stores also suffered as an expected \\nlast minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store \\nsales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt \\nlittle Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month \\nlast year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw \\na dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry \\nforecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the \\ndesertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According \\nto a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net \\nRatings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSteady job growth continues in US \\n \\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said \\nthat the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world\\'s biggest \\neconomy. \\n \\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last \\nmonth. That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five \\nyears. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US \\neconomy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady \\ngrowth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in \\nDecember, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if \\nthat figure is to drop. \\n \\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa \\nSecurities. \\n \\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus \\nforecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an \\nincrease in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area \\nof the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication \\nthat the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal \\nReserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The \\nFed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence \\nthe US economic recovery was becoming more robust. \\n \\nJob creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and \\nproved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. \\nWhile demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for \\nsteady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it \\njust keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" \\nin 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, \\neconomists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal \\nReserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A \\nfall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US \\neconomic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest \\nrate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a \\nfall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, \\nwhile noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBarclays shares up on merger talk \\n \\nShares in UK banking group Barclays have risen on Monday following a \\nweekend press report that it had held merger talks with US bank Wells \\nFargo. \\n \\nA tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create \\nthe world\\'s fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn (Â£96bn). Barclays has \\ndeclined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does \\nnot respond to market speculation. The two banks reportedly held talks in \\nOctober and November 2004. \\n \\nBarclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in \\nLondon on Monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 \\nindex. UK banking icon Barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it \\nhas operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. \\nIts North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells \\nFargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. \\nIn 2003, Barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£3.8bn, and \\nit has recently forecast similar gains in 2004, predicting that full year \\npre-tax profits would rise 18% to Â£4.5bn. Wells Fargo had net income of \\n$6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, \\nand revenues of $28.4bn. Barclays was the focus of takeover speculation \\nin August, when it was linked to Citigroup, though no bid has ever \\nmaterialised. Stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports \\nheralded a deal. \"The chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he \\ndidn\\'t talk to rivals, but a deal doesn\\'t seem likely,\" Reuters quoted \\none trader as saying. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK Coal plunges into deeper loss \\n \\nShares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had \\ndeepened to Â£51.6m in 2004 from Â£1.2m. \\n \\nThe UK\\'s biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial \\naction and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening \\nfortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry \\nSpindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on \\nThursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was \\nmaking \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had \\nintroduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for \\nmachinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse \\nconditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift \\nearnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to \\nprofitability in 2006. \\n \\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most \\nof its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were \\nÂ£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was \\njust Â£1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these \\nissues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been \\nmade,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines \\nacross Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West \\nMidlands, Northumberland and Durham. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChinese exports rise 25% in 2004 \\n \\nExports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the \\ncountry continued to show breakneck growth. \\n \\nThe spurt put China\\'s trade surplus - a sore point with some of its \\ntrading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on \\nChina to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening \\ndollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China\\'s \\ntax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year \\nin a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a \\ntightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid \\nexpansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan \\n($311bn; Â£165bn). \\n \\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China\\'s exports totalled $63.8bn \\nin December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports \\nrising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax \\ntake comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn \\nyuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China\\'s exporting success has made the \\ntrade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with \\nChina a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan \\naround 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses \\nat home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-\\nmandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and \\n2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said \\nthe report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, \\nmoving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. \\nThe US\\'s overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is \\nexpected to rise to about $150bn for 2004. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nKarachi stocks hit historic high \\n \\nThe Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day \\ngain, surging 3.5% to a new high. \\n \\nThe index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many \\ninvestors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic \\nboom. The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 \\npoints in the first two trading days of the week. Energy and \\ntelecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% \\nrise since Monday morning. \\n \\nIn 2002, the KSE was the world\\'s best performing stock market, with the \\nindex rising 112%. \\n \\nPakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, \\nits 2002 performance. Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the \\nmarket closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will \\ncontinue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, \\nhowever, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of \\nprices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any \\ntime\". \"That\\'s rubbish,\" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News \\nwebsite. \"Whenever the market reflects Pakistan\\'s true economic reality, \\nit is described as a bubble.\" Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen \\non the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on \\nsound foundations. \\n \\nMarket analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there \\nare a number of major factors behind the KSE\\'s performance. Analysts \\nargue that a steady improvement in Pakistan\\'s credit ratings by \\ninternational credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the \\nmarket. Standard & Poor\\'s upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. There are \\nindications of yet another upgrade by the end of February. \\n \\nThen, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current \\nfiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"Coupled with the \\n7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the \\nmarket\\'s performance,\" says Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said \\nthe real reasons may be political. \"If you file a $1.3 trillion case \\nagainst Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any \\nmore.\" A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and \\nIndonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the \\nstrongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE. \\n \\nLocally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to \\nthe market\\'s advantage. \\n \\nAn anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance \\nof religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, \\nformer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto\\'s husband, has eased political \\ntensions between the military-backed government and the opposition \\nPakistan People\\'s Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of \\ntalks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-\\nadministered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. \\nThis, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising \\nthe temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their \\ndisagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial \\ninvestment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally \\nas deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian \\nneighbours. \"You can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"Let \\nus see how long one can reap its benefits.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS trade gap ballooned in October \\n \\nThe US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October, hitting \\nrecord levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have \\nshown \\n \\nThe trade shortfall was $55.5bn (Â£29bn), up 9% from September, the \\nCommerce Department said. That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. \\nImports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker \\ndollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive \\nexport demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that\\'s to \\nbe expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor\\'s in New York. \"The \\nfirst thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of \\nimports. \"We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going \\nin the right direction.\" \\n \\nDespite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the US will \\nfund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. Another \\nproblem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, \\nwhich has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order \\nto boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China \\nduring October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry \\nthat has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony \\nCrescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade \\ndeficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The \\nCommerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite \\nwidespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest \\nrates for a fifth time this year. Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a \\nquarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a Fed meeting later on Tuesday. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSaudi ministry to employ women \\n \\nWomen will be employed in Saudi Arabia\\'s foreign ministry for the first \\ntime this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported \\nas saying. \\n \\nThe move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to \\nworking women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told \\ngovernment departments to put plans in place for employing women. But \\nprogress has been slow, reports from the country say. \\n \\nEarlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-\\nGosaibi had \"caused uproar\" when he said his ministry was having \\ndifficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The \\nnewspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \"a pitiful excuse \\nfor not employing women\". Women now make up more than half of all \\ngraduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. \"Our \\neducational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and \\nprofessionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful \\nposition in Saudi society,\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. \"I am \\nproud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the \\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS prepares for hybrid onslaught \\n \\nSales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research \\nsuggests. \\n \\nResearch group JD Power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite \\nhigher prices and customer scepticism. Carmakers are starting to build \\nhybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles \\nwhich now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption \\nand emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor \\nconstantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, \\nnotably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. \\nEqually, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that \\nconsumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a \\nyear on fuel. \\n \\nAt the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently \\ndisplaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date \\nwith the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish \\ntheir \"green\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of \\nits Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in \\nthe year. \\n \\nHonda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese \\ncarmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold \\n4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a \\nhybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans \\nfor three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and \\nis showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may \\njoin the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to \\nhybridise its Cayenne SUV. \\n \\nOthers remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota\\'s hybrid \\ntechnology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"We want \\nto make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" Nissan chief \\nexecutive Carlos Ghosn said. \"We will not be surprised by any \\nacceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" Volkswagen, \\nmeanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. \\nAnd some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of \\n$3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of \\nthe technology - may still cool its attraction. \"The average consumers \\naren\\'t willing to pay that premium for a car they won\\'t drive more than \\nsix years,\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil prices fall back from highs \\n \\nOil prices retreated from four-month highs in early trading on Tuesday \\nafter producers\\' cartel Opec said it was now unlikely to cut production. \\n \\nFollowing the comments by acting Opec secretary general Adnan Shihab-\\nEldin, US light crude fell 32 cents to $51.43 a barrel. He said that high \\noil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in \\nthe second quarter. In London, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a \\nbarrel. \\n \\nOpec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 March. \\nOn Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-\\nmonth high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil. US \\ndemand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this \\nweek, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year \\nago. Cold weather across Europe has also put upward pressure on crude \\nprices. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman economy rebounds \\n \\nGermany\\'s economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, \\ngrew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong \\nexports. \\n \\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical \\noffice said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by \\n8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. \\nConcerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic \\ndemand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left \\nits benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the \\nnineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. \\nEconomists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second \\nhalf of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite. \\n \\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was \\nstrong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If \\nexports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much \\nfrom 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by \\ngovernment attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate \\nenvironment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and \\nSiemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming \\njobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting \\nmeasures on the horizon. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS Ahold suppliers face charges \\n \\nUS prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch \\nretailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (Â£428m). \\n \\nThe charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies, \\nalleging they created false accounts. Ahold hit the headlines in February \\n2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US \\nsubsidiary Foodservice. Three former Ahold top executives last year \\nagreed to settle fraud charges. \\n \\nAhold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances \\nat Foodservice, improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed \\nother accounting errors and irregularities. \\n \\nThe nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of \\nsigning false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the \\nretailer for promoting their products in its stores. Food companies pay \\nsupermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. The suppliers in \\nquestion are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, \\nproviding auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its \\nearnings. US Attorney David Kelley said he expects the nine vendors will \\nplead guilty to the charges. He added that there may be more court \\nactions in the future. \"I don\\'t want to leave you with the impression \\nthat these were the only ones involved,\" he said. Among those facing \\ncharges are John Nettle, a former employee of General Mills; Mark Bailin \\nof Rymer International Seafood; Tim Daly of Michael Foods and Kenneth \\nBowman, who worked as an independent contractor for Total Foods. \\n \\nOthers include Michael Hannigan of Sugar Foods; Peter Marion of Maritime \\nSeafood Processors and First Choice Foods; Gordon Redgate of Commodity \\nManager and Private Label Distribution; Bruce Robinson of Basic American \\nFoods and Michael Rogers, formerly of Tyson Foods. Pasquale D\\'Amuro of \\nthe FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in \"the process of \\ncooking the books\" at Ahold. At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen \\nby many as Europe\\'s Enron. Ahold shares tumbled on the news and many \\nmarket observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor \\nconfidence across Europe. It was less severe than many had envisaged, \\nhowever, and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its \\nreputation and investor confidence. Ahold is the world\\'s fourth-largest \\nsupermarket chain. Its other US businesses include Stop & Shop, and Giant \\nFood. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS retail sales surge in December \\n \\nUS retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in \\nDecember, boosted by strong car sales. \\n \\nSeasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month, compared to 0.1% a \\nmonth earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after \\nChristmas. Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an \\n8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a \\n4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out \\nof showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain \\nsales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales \\nboom was slow to get started. \\n \\nThe increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month \\nto $349.4bn (Â£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 \\ntrillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 \\ntrillion However, if automotives are excluded from December\\'s data, \\nretail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. Home furnishings and furniture \\nstores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the \\nshops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their \\npurchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, \\nanalysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal \\nReserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. \\n\"Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US \\nexpansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue \\nboosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,\" UBS economist Maury \\nHarris told Reuters. \\n \\nRetail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in \\nturn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending \\nhas been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 \\nas the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade \\nand the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a \\nlacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts \\nnow expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street \\nwith consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the \\nlatest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. \\nThe number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, \\nthe highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to \\ntheir lowest level since 2001. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMcDonald\\'s boss Bell dies aged 44 \\n \\nCharlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant \\nMcDonald\\'s, has died of cancer aged 44. \\n \\nMr Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in May last year, a month \\nafter taking over the top job. He resigned in November to fight the \\nillness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell \\nquickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia\\'s youngest store \\nmanager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive \\nMcDonald\\'s sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. \"As we mourn his \\npassing, I ask you to keep Charlie\\'s family in your hearts and prayers,\" \\nchief executive James Skinner said in a statement. \"And remember that in \\nhis abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest.\" \\n\"No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for \\nhis family and for McDonald\\'s.\" \\n \\nAfter running the company\\'s Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell \\nmoved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle \\nEast. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald\\'s second most \\nimportant market. He became chief operating officer and president in \\n2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, \\nJim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked \\nclosely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald\\'s \\naround, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather \\nthan follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the \\ncompany get \"fat, dumb and happy,\" and, according to Reuters, once told \\nanalysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors \\nif he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald\\'s \"I\\'m lovin\\' it\" \\nadvertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the \\nbiggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. Colleagues said \\nthat Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash \\ntills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS industrial output growth eases \\n \\nUS industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a \\nslower pace than the previous month. \\n \\nThe US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities \\nrose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in \\nOctober. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw \\nproduction fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more \\nimpressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in \\nthe past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US \\neconomy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a \\nrecovery in retail sales. \"This is very consistent with an economy \\ngrowing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer \\noptimism,\" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures. \\n \\nThe US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three \\nmonths between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 \\nduring the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, \\nexperts believe they are enough to whittle away at America\\'s 5.4% jobless \\nrate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output \\ndrove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But \\nutility output dropped 1.4%. Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in \\nuse during the month rose to 77.6% - its highest level since May 2001. \\n\"Many investors think that product market inflation won\\'t be a problem \\nuntil the utilisation rates are at 80% or higher,\" Cary Leahy, senior US \\neconomist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. \"So there is still a lot of \\ninflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector,\" \"Overall I\\'d say \\nmanufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would \\nbet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean \\ninventories are,\" Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n\\'Golden economic period\\' to end \\n \\nTen years of \"golden\" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 \\nwith growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned. \\n \\nThe UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing \\nmarket, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in \\nunemployment. Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, \\nbelow Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes \\nthat interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year. \\n \\nIn its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had \\nenjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment \\nfalling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the \\n1960s. \\n \\nBut it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of \\ncreating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte\\'s chief economic \\nadvisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from \\nthe housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \\n\"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust \\nhousehold spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market \\nslowdown gathers pace.\" \\n \\nEconomic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by \\nincreased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte \\nbelieves. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to \\nsustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will \\nresult in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last \\nyear, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that \\nthe slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while \\nit expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the \\neconomy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts \\nover the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its \\ncurrent 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be \\nthe year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start \\nof a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndustrial output falls in Japan \\n \\nJapanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose, \\ncasting further doubt on the strength of the country\\'s economic recovery. \\n \\nProduction dropped 1.6% in October, reflecting a decline in exports, \\nwhile unemployment levels edged up 0.1% to 4.7%, slightly higher than \\nforecast. The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed \\ndramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. Japan\\'s \\ngovernment remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand. \\n \\nAnalysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial \\noutput. \\n \\nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry \\n(METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for \\nmobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% \\nmonth on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. \"It\\'s a sign that \\nthe economy\\'s adjustment phase is stronger than expected,\" said Takashi \\nYamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japan downgraded its overall \\neconomic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year. \\n \\nGrowth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% \\nin the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe the economy -which \\nstagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the \\nback of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government \\nofficials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer \\ndemand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I \\ndon\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the \\nfall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, \\njobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent \\nyears. The comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the \\nNikkei down 1% in afternoon trade. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJobs go at Oracle after takeover \\n \\nOracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the \\ncompletion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last \\nweek. \\n \\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product \\ndevelopment and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of \\nthe 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracle\\'s 18-month fight to \\nacquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US \\ntakeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a \\nmajor force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to \\nGermany\\'s SAP. \\n \\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on \\nFriday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. \"By \\nretaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will \\nhave the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments \\nwe have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,\" Oracle\\'s \\nchief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement. \\n \\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest \\nmore cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying \\nto placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle\\'s determined takeover \\nstrategy. Hours before Friday\\'s announcement, there was a funereal air at \\nPeoplesoft\\'s headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had \\nbeen turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company \\nmemorabilia. \"We\\'re mourning the passing of a great company,\" the agency \\nquoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they \\nwould rather be sacked than work for Oracle. \"The new company is going to \\nbe totally different,\" said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft\\'s director of \\ndatabase markets. \"Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. \\nOracle has an edgy, aggressive atmosphere that\\'s not conducive to \\ninnovative production.\" On the news, Oracle shares rose 15 cents - 1.1% - \\non Nasdaq. In after-hours trading the shares did not move. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBeijingers fume over parking fees \\n \\nChoking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at \\nreorganising car parking charges. \\n \\nCar ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a \\nhalf million cars on the city\\'s roads. The trouble is that the high \\nstatus of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, \\nmaking motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged \\nby drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price \\ndifferences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang \\nYan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development \\nand Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is \\nin charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking \\nat adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can \\ncost up to 250% more than outdoor ones. \\n \\nSports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of \\nthe commission\\'s road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is \\nconsidering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr \\nWang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near \\nsuch places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking \\nmay be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang\\'s team are also going \\nto look into complaints from residents about poor service received in \\nexchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; Â£26). The \\nBeijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign \\ndignitaries\\' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as \\nthey blocked the traffic. Unclogging Beijing\\'s increasingly impassable \\nstreets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building \\ndozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 \\nOlympic Games. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGM issues 2005 profits warning \\n \\nGeneral Motors has warned that it expects earnings this year be lower \\nthan in 2004. \\n \\nThe world\\'s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European \\nbusiness, and weak US sales. GM said higher healthcare costs in North \\nAmerica, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would \\nhurt its performance in 2005. GM said it expects to meet its 2004 \\nearnings targets \"despite a tough competitive environment\". \\n \\nGM, whose brands include Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet in the US and \\nOpel, Saab and Vauxhall in Europe, is due to reveal 2004 earnings on 19 \\nJanuary. \\n \\nIt said it would deliver a shareholder payout of $6.0-$6.5 per share this \\nyear, as promised, but that next year\\'s earnings per share would be \\nlower, at between $4.0-$5.0. \"We\\'re following a roadmap that we believe \\nwill deliver strong results,\" said GM chief executive Rick Waggoner. GM \\nsaid it was expecting \"reduced financial losses\" in Europe in 2005. It is \\nin the midst of cutting 12,000 jobs - one fifth of the European total - \\nin a bid to cut costs. The biggest job losses are in Germany. Its vehicle \\nbusinesses have gained market share in three out of four regions in 2004, \\nachieving record profitability in Asia Pacific and returning to profit in \\nLatin America, the Middle East and Africa. The car maker has diversified \\ninto financial services, and is extending the reach of General Motors \\nAcceptance Corp (GMAC), which has said it may enter the home loans \\nmarket. GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said \\nit will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn. \\n\"Attaining earnings of $10 a share remains GM\\'s goal,\" the company said, \\nadding it believes it can achieve this in 2007. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nLufthansa flies back to profit \\n \\nGerman airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting \\nhuge losses in 2003. \\n \\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros \\n($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. \\nOperating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. \\nLufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand \\nfollowing the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by \\ntroubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs \\nof recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the \\nbrink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 \\ndividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a \\ndividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 \\nresults on 23 March. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWinn-Dixie files for bankruptcy \\n \\nUS supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after \\nsuccumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart. \\n \\nWinn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 \\nprotection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 \\nstores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load \\na number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts \\nof $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest \\ncreditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m. \\n \\nAnalysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers\\' demands and had \\nalso been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month \\nrestructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-\\nexpected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie\\'s slide into \\nbankruptcy was widely expected. The company\\'s new chief executive Peter \\nLynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take \\nthe necessary action to turn itself around. \"This includes achieving \\nsignificant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer \\nservice in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the \\nstores,\" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, \\nsaid Mr Lynch\\'s job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably \\nput off some customers. \"The real big issue is what\\'s going to happen \\nover the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all \\ntheir customers see this in their local newspapers,\" he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS economy still growing says Fed \\n \\nMost areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and \\nearly January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book \\nreport. \\n \\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger \\neconomic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \\n\"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, \\nand festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also \\nimproved, the Fed said. \\n \\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures \\ngenerally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts \\nreported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, \\nbut most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" \\nThe report added that residential real estate activity remained strong \\nand that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \\n\"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, \\ntwo of the nation\\'s strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSaab to build Cadillacs in Sweden \\n \\nGeneral Motors, the world\\'s largest car maker, has confirmed that it will \\nbuild a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in \\nSweden. \\n \\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the \\nmedium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM \\nEurope president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the \\nUS marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac \\nwith a diesel engine. \\n \\nGM\\'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory\\'s \\nclosure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours \\nabout GM\\'s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. \\nBut the group\\'s new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed \\nby the group\\'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have \\nto face a larger proportion of GM\\'s cuts. \\n \\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, \\nsince it reflects Saab\\'s failure to make significant inroads into the \\nlucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently \\nsaid it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment\\'s \\nleaders do not agree. \\n \\nGM\\'s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts \\nto push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the \\nUS, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the \\npresidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for \\nCadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury \\ncar makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed \\ntremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads \\nin Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained \\ntheir stranglehold on the luxury market. \\n \\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-\\nneeded scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than \\n130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers \\nconsider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing \\nmoney fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (Â£104m; 151m \\neuros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced \\nlast year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by \\nbuilding Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs \\non the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share \\nparts. Another way to further reduce Saab\\'s losses could be to shift some \\nof the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted \\nit as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the \\nweak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But \\nnot everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \\n\"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is \\ntoday,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC \\nNews. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said. \\n \\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European \\nconsumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to \\ndeploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting \\npotential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar \\ninitiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers\\' \\nperceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality \\nhad improved in recent years. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBank voted 8-1 for no rate change \\n \\nThe decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month \\nwas passed 8-1 by the Bank of England\\'s rate-setting body, minutes have \\nshown. \\n \\nOne member of the Bank\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - \\nvoted to raise rates to 5%. The news surprised some analysts who had \\nexpected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries \\nover growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to \\nfreeze rates, the minutes showed. The Bank\\'s latest inflation report, \\nreleased last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall \\nwas weaker consumer spending. \\n \\nHowever, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in \\ninterest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up, and \\nthat the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than \\nexpected. \\n \\nThe Bank\\'s minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were \\n\"sufficiently to the downside\" to keep rates on hold at its latest \\nmeeting. However, the minutes added: \"Some members noted that an increase \\nmight be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the \\ncentral projection\". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, \\nsaid he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He \\nsaid the minutes appeared to be \"trying to get the market to focus on the \\npossibility of a rise in rates\". \"If the economy pans out as they expect \\nthen they are probably going to have to hike rates.\" However, he added, \\nany rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC \\nmembers likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer \\nspending before acting. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndustrial revival hope for Japan \\n \\nJapanese industry is growing faster than expected, boosting hopes that \\nthe country\\'s retreat back into recession is over. \\n \\nIndustrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January \\nfrom a month earlier. At the same time, retail sales picked up faster \\nthan at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month \\nhigh, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of \\ncontraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day \\nup 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the \\ndollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan\\'s \\neconomy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% \\ncontraction in the final three months of last year after two previous \\nquarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in \\nthe early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. \\nThe output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic \\nofficials. \"Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious \\nrecession,\" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning \\nthat other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying. \\n \\nWithin the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a \\npullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were \\nkey overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods. \\nWith US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in \\nearly 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also \\none of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as \\nflat-screen TVs in high demand during January. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nKhodorkovsky ally denies charges \\n \\nA close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a \\ncourt that fraud charges levelled against him are \"false\". \\n \\nPlaton Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in \\na case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair \\nclaim they are being punished by the authorities for the political \\nambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were \"absurd \\ncontradictions\" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not \\nsee the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include \\nallegations of tax evasion. \"To my embarrassment, I could not understand \\nthe file of complaints against me,\" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev \\nheaded the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos. \\n \\nMr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail \\nsentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few \\ndays. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court \\nthat he objected to the way that the \"running of a normal business has \\nbeen presented as a work of criminal fiction\". The charges are seen by \\nsupporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian \\nPresident Vladimir Putin to rein in the country\\'s super-rich business \\nleaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn \\n(Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk \\ndivision was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company\\'s effort \\nto gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the \\nsale - were dismissed by a court in Texas. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChina keeps tight rein on credit \\n \\nChina\\'s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on \\ncredit will continue into 2005, state media report. \\n \\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that \\nrapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that \\ntoo much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in \\nChina remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at \\nmore than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept \\ngrowth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s \\nmanufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the \\nfactors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. \\nIn theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist \\nthat the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an \\noverbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a \\nrate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - \\nmeans Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far \\nresisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift \\nthe level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be \\ntaking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down \\nfrom 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail \\nsales are still booming. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nVerizon \\'seals takeover of MCI\\' \\n \\nVerizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth \\n$6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say. \\n \\nThe two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according \\nto news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from \\nQwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-\\ndistance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this \\nyear for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under \\nprevious name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 \\nthat it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. \\n \\nShareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 \\nworkers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently \\non trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come \\nunder suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and \\nExchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it \\nmanipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy. \\n \\nMCI is the US\\'s second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. \\nConsolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the \\npast few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A \\nmerger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms \\ndeal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its \\nformer parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI \\nwould give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI\\'s global network and \\nbusiness-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one \\nunderpinning SBC\\'s AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and \\nhas its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the \\nboard in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and \\nshares. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCrossrail link \\'to get go-ahead\\' \\n \\nThe Â£10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get \\nthe go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday. \\n \\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated Â£7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project \\nand that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin \\nshortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast \\ncross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of \\nCommons on 23 February. \\n \\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We\\'ve always said we \\nare going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this \\nremains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de \\nSouza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm \\nwhether the Treasury was planning to invest Â£7.5bn or when the bill \\nwould go before Parliament. \\n \\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of \\nan election. \\n \\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of \\nLondon, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the \\nCity would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for \\nbusiness travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has \\nthe support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and \\nthe government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it \\nshould be funded. The Mail on Sunday\\'s Financial Mail said the Â£7.5bn of \\nTreasury money was earmarked for spending in Â£2.5bn instalments in 2010, \\n2011 and 2012. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSmall firms \\'hit by rising costs\\' \\n \\nRising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the UK\\'s \\nsmall manufacturers despite a rise in output, business lobby group the \\nCBI says. \\n \\nA CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in \\nseven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing \\nexpenses. The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and \\nretraining is forecast to go up over the next year. However, firms \\ncontinue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery. \\n \\nThe CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the \\nregulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold. \\n\"Smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle,\" said Hugh Morgan \\nWilliams, chair of the CBI\\'s SME Council. \"The manufacturing sector needs \\na period of long-term stability in the economy.\" The CBI found some firms \\nmanaged to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many \\nsaid increases failed to keep up the rise in costs. Of the companies \\nsurveyed, 30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall. The positive balance \\nof plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey. When firms were \\nquestioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - \\nthe highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when \\nlooking ahead to the next three months. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDeutsche Boerse boosts dividend \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its \\nLondon rival, has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%. \\n \\nAnalysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to \\nits bid for the London Stock Exchange. Critics of the takeover have \\ncomplained that the money could be better used by returning cash to \\nshareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 \\nDecember was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; Â£83.3m). Sales climbed to 364.4m \\neuros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros. \\n \\nFrankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered Â£1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn \\neuros) for the London Stock Exchange. Rival pan-European bourse Euronext \\nis working also on a bid. Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would \\nlift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (Â£0.48; $0.98) from 55 \\neuro cents a year earlier. \"There is a whiff of a sweetener in there,\" \\nAnais Faraj, an analyst at Nomura told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \\n\"Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining \\nthat the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in \\ntheir hands, paid out in dividends,\" Mr Faraj continued. Deutsche Boerse \\nis \"trying to buy them off in a sense\", he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapanese growth grinds to a halt \\n \\nGrowth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking \\nrenewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. \\n \\nOutput in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - \\nthe usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed \\nsubdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well \\nshort of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of \\nexpansion. \\n \\nThe economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief \\nspurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was \\ndeflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese \\nshoppers cautious and kept them from spending. \\n \\nThe effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports \\nfor its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the \\ngrowth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US \\nare becoming relatively more expensive. \\n \\nThe performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier \\nin the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the \\nsecond showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% \\nthis time around. \"Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,\" \\nsaid Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \\n\"Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary \\nfactors such as the Olympics. \"The amber light is flashing.\" The \\ngovernment may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it \\nwill have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with \\nJapan\\'s massive public debt. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBrewers\\' profits lose their fizz \\n \\nHeineken and Carlsberg, two of the world\\'s largest brewers, have reported \\nfalling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat. \\n \\nDutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that \\nearnings in 2005 may also slide. Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% \\nfall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both \\nare looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western \\nEuropean markets are largely mature. \\n \\nHeineken\\'s net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; Â£371m) during 2004, \\nfrom 798m euro a year ago. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and \\ncurrency losses. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, \\nwhich has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its \\noperating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken\\'s sales have been \\nimproving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from \\n9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in \\n\"aggressive\" and \"high-impact\" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. \\nHeineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy\\'s stout brands, said it \\nwould also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries. \\n \\nHeineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but \\nwarned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased \\nmarketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit. \\n \\nCarlsberg, the world\\'s fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits \\nfall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been \\naffected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking \\nin pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales \\nincreased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in \\nRussia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, \\nprojecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, it also plans \\nto cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, \\nimported brands. \"We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term \\noutlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, \\nsocial and structural reasons,\" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of \\nCarlsberg. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRussia WTO talks \\'make progress\\' \\n \\nTalks on Russia\\'s proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation \\n(WTO) have been \"making good progress\" say those behind the negotiations. \\n \\nBut the chairman of the working party, Ambassador Stefan Johannesson of \\nIceland, warned that there was \"still a lot of work has to be done\". His \\ncomments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian \\nentry. But he said for Russia to make progress the government must \"renew \\na commitment to democracy and the rule of law\". His comments come three \\ndays before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin. \\n \\nRussia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally \\nbecome a member by early 2006. A decision could be reached in December, \\nwhen the WTO\\'s 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. That \\nwould allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006, if the Hong \\nKong summit gave its approval. While pinpointing several areas in which \\nthere are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with \\nRussia, the US said the meeting was \"much more efficient than we\\'ve seen \\nfor some time\". And Australia said it was \"one of the best (meetings) we \\ncan recall in terms of substance\". Mr Johannesson also said progress \"on \\nthe bilateral market access side is accelerating\". Sticking points to \\nmembership have included limits on foreign ownership in the \\ntelecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues \\nsurrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection. Some WTO members \\nalso dislike Russia\\'s energy price subsidies, which competitors say give \\nRussian businesses an unfair advantage. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndia\\'s rupee hits five-year high \\n \\nIndia\\'s rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) \\nraised the country\\'s foreign currency rating. \\n \\nThe rupee climbed to 43.305 per US dollar on Thursday, up from a close of \\n43.41. The currency has gained almost 1% in the past three sessions. S&P, \\nwhich rates borrowers\\' creditworthiness, lifted India\\'s rating by one \\nnotch to \\'BB+\\'. With Indian assets now seen as less of a gamble, more \\ncash is expected to flow into its markets, buoying the rupee. \\n \\n\"The upgrade is positive and basically people will use it as an excuse to \\ncome back to India,\" said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS. \"Money has \\nmoved out from India in the first two or three weeks of January into \\nother markets like Korea and Thailand and this upgrade should lead to a \\nreversal.\" India\\'s foreign currency rating is now one notch below \\ninvestment grade, which starts at \\'BBB-\\'. The increase has put it on the \\nsame level as Romania, Egypt and El Salvador, and one level below Russia. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDollar drops on reserves concerns \\n \\nThe US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that \\ncentral banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign \\nreserves. \\n \\nComments by South Korea\\'s central bank at the end of last week have \\nsparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea, which has about \\n$200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of \\ncurrencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon \\nthat other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, \\nthe euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. The \\nBritish pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the \\ndollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 \\nyen. \\n \\nAt the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the \\neuro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, \\nstaged something of a recovery. \\n \\nAnalysts, however, pointed to the dollar\\'s inability recently to extend \\nthat rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted \\nthe fact that many of the US\\'s economic problems had not disappeared. The \\nfocus once again has been on the country\\'s massive trade and budget \\ndeficits, with predictions of more dollar weakness to come. \"The comments \\nfrom Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already \\nsoftening,\" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial. On Tuesday, \\ntraders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their \\nbids to buy dollars at the start of the session. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, \\nchief currency strategist at UBS, said that there was a sentiment in the \\nmarket that \"central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying \\neuros\". A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its \\nallure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. \\nCompiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK\\'s Royal \\nBank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were \\nincreasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndia and Russia in energy talks \\n \\nIndia and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part \\nof a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas \\nprojects. \\n \\nOn the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, \\nto be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India\\'s ONGC. The Indian \\nfirm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in \\nassets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% \\nstake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was \\ncontroversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned \\nenergy giant Rosneft. \\n \\nRussian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of \\nunderstanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between \\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman \\nAleksey Miller and India\\'s petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. \\n \\nThe agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining \\nfacilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, \\ngas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across \\nAsia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far \\neast of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects \\nin eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea. \\n \\nIndia is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly \\nliquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a \\nyear. \\n \\nONGC\\'s Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next \\nyear. \"At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" \\nhe told Reuters. \"What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of \\ngas and we have the money. \"The investment may go up to $20bn or more for \\na period of five years or so.\" \\n \\nRussian news agencies reported that India\\'s petroleum minister Mr Aiyar \\nand Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of \\nYugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC\\'s Mr Raha declined to be drawn on \\nhis firm\\'s reported interest in the company. However, he stressed that \\nONGC was not interested in a \\'loan-for-oil deal\\' in connection to \\nYugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China\\'s \\nNational Petroleum Corporation. \"China\\'s problem is it has immediate \\ndemand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. \\nWe would like long-term security through equity participation.\" It is \\nthought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court \\nhas decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing \\na host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay \\na huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any \\nbusiness which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak data buffets French economy \\n \\nA batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French \\neconomy\\'s future prospects. \\n \\nOfficial figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% \\nlast month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October. At \\nthe same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil \\nprices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on \\nconsumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he \\nsaid. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the \\nyear as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand. \\n \\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a \\ntime of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The \\nunemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we \\nhave growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, \\nan economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the \\nwill and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, \\notherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer \\ncontributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to \\nhire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many \\neconomists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing \\nnon-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. \\nThe French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about \\n2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business \\ninvestment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above \\n2%. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBusiness fears over sluggish EU economy \\n \\nAs European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU \\nconstitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to \\nhome - namely how to stay in business. \\n \\nLille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of \\nFrance at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively \\ngrand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, \\nand consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern \\nEnglish towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like \\nnorthern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in \\nlong term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a \\nspecialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. The \\ncompany has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making \\nbolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many \\nof those are being built in Europe these days. \\n \\nDirector Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories \\nin the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while \\nhis key markets are now in China and India. \"In our business the market \\nis absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of \\nbusiness) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we \\nwould need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. It isn\\'t \\njust globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are \\npaid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least \\nthere is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and \\ntextiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough \\nto make up the difference. \\n \\nThat is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says \\nFrederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille. \\n \\n\"In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is \\n15%. They don\\'t see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of \\neuro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. Which is \\nstrange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should \\nbe benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase \\ntrade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been \\nwith the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world\\'s \\nlargest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker \\nHuisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken \\nRussian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now \\nsetting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main \\ncustomers are closer. \\n \\nBoss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of \\norders closer to home. \"In the US growth is something like 6%, in China \\nthey are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,\" he says. \\nMr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old \\ncurrencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country\\'s economic \\nperformance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the \\neconomy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high \\nunemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In \\nBritain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in \\nrecent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone\\'s economy, \\nthis is a major problem. If Germany doesn\\'t once again become the \\npowerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as \\nstrong as it could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border \\nthings are changing. \\n \\nThe Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 \\nstaff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra \\npay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to \\nHungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to \\nincrease productivity \"by nearly 30%\". But Germany needs much more reform \\nif all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The \\nGovernment is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous \\nunemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low \\nskilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the \\nStudy of Labour at Bonn University. \"Labour is too costly in Germany, \\nespecially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we \\ncould solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. The \\nEU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world \\nby 2010. Four years into that process, and the target seems further away \\nthan ever. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nM&S cuts prices by average of 24% \\n \\nMarks & Spencer has cut prices in London and the regions by an average of \\n24%, according to research from a City investment bank. \\n \\nDresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said: \"In spite of the snow in the UK, it \\nstill feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise.\" \\nStuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high. \"We \\nare bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market \\nretailers like Next,\" said M&S. \\n \\nNext is one of M&S\\'s biggest competitors and the move may force it to \\nlower prices. DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could \\nindicate a longer term \"step change in pricing in certain areas\" at M&S. \\n\"Either way, this cannot be good news for M&S\\' margin,\" it added. \"We \\nhave brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part \\nof Stuart Rose\\'s strategy of quality, style -and price,\" said the M&S \\nspokesman. Many analysts believe February is proving to be a difficult \\nmonth for retailers and British Retail Consortium figures, due in a few \\nweeks, are expected to reflect the tough trading environment. Separately, \\ninvestment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of \\n35 M&S goods is now 11% above the high-street average, compared with 43% \\nhigher last year. \\n \\nIt has been a strange week for M&S, which on Tuesday received a statement \\nfrom Philip Green, the billionaire Bhs owner, confirming he was not \\nrebidding for the company. This was followed the same day by Mark \\nPaulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his \\nPaulsmeier Group was interested in M&S. A sudden spike in M&S\\'s share \\nprice followed. However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no \\nevidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. He \\nalso said the Takeover Panel and the UK\\'s financial watchdog the \\nFinancial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning \\nof the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFiat chief takes steering wheel \\n \\nThe chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control \\nof its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around. \\n \\nSergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat \\nAuto, with Mr Demel leaving the company. Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth \\nhead of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss \\nin 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last \\nyear, seeing flat sales. \\n \\nThe car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years \\nand was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The \\nmanagement changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following \\nFiat\\'s resolution of its dispute with General Motors. As part of a major \\nrestructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently \\nowned by Ferrari - within its own operations. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns \\na majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in \\neither 2006 or 2007. \\n \\nMr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was \\nnow the \"principal focus\" of his attention. \"I have made the decision to \\ntake on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the \\ncompany\\'s recovery,\" he said. \"A profound cultural transformation is \\nunderway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more \\nagile and efficient structure,\" he added. \\n \\nAlthough Mr Marchionne does not have a background in the car industry, he \\nhas been playing an increasing role in the group\\'s activities. Last year, \\nhe said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group\\'s \\nrecovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. The car \\nbusiness, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a \\nloss of about 800m euros in 2004. Sales are expected to fall in 2005, \\nFiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental \\ncar market. Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November \\n2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe \\nMorchio. Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the \\ndeath of president Umberto Agnelli. However, this was rejected by the \\nfounding Agnelli family and Mr Morchio subsequently resigned. Earlier \\nthis week, Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance \\nwhich could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright. GM will pay \\nFiat $2bn as part of the settlement. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK \\'risks breaking golden rule\\' \\n \\nThe UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it \\nwants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests. \\n \\nThe rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and \\nnot to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic \\nand Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about \\nÂ£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its \\nplans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the \\ngovernment\\'s current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \\n\"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year \\nearlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal \\ntightening is needed, NIESR said. \\n \\nThe report is the latest to call into question the viability of \\ngovernment spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm \\nErnst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown\\'s \\nforecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. \\n \\nIt claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of \\nthe tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A \\nTreasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on \\ntrack to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle \\nand beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are \\nfully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the \\nNIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. \\n \\nIt said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a \\nlimited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world \\neconomy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product \\n(GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before \\npicking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion \\nuntil 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in \\nJapan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \\n\"is expected to pick up speed\". \\n \\nGrowth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak \\ngrowth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain \\nintact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR \\nsaid, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next \\ntwo years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, \\nand 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR \\nsaid, was the UK\\'s much analysed and fretted over property market. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWorldCom director admits lying \\n \\nThe former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has \\nadmitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board \\nmembers. \\n \\nSpeaking at the trial of his former boss Bernard Ebbers, Scott Sullivan \\nsaid he lied to the board to cover up the hole in WorldCom\\'s finances. Mr \\nEbbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom\\'s \\ncollapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its \\naccounts by $11bn (Â£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty \\nto fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers\\' trial, where he is \\nappearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted \\nthat he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom\\'s finances. \\n \\nIn the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers\\' lawyer Reid Weingarten \\nasked Mr Sullivan: \"If you believe something is in your interest, you are \\nwilling and able to lie to accomplish it, isn\\'t that right?\" \\n \\n\"On that date, yes. I was lying,\" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has \\nsuggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter \\nsentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a \\nsuggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert \\nRoberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. \\nThe trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week. \\n \\nUnder 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has \\npreviously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that \\nfalsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue \\nand earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to \\nstop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted \\nof all the charges he is facing. WorldCom\\'s problems appear to have begun \\nwith the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet \\ncompanies. Prosecutors allege that the company\\'s top executives responded \\nby orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged \\nfrom bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCall centre users \\'lose patience\\' \\n \\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and \\nquicker to hang up, a survey suggests. \\n \\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 \\nseconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the \\nnumber of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \\n\"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' \\nsociety,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned \\nthe survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers \\nsimply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record \\n13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken \\nout of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through \\nmultiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even \\nhigher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible \\nreason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more \\ncustomers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones. \\n \\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a \\nreflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre \\nmay have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible \\nfor credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. \\nProblems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going \\nhand-in-hand with more training, the survey found. \\n \\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average \\ninduction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 \\ndays, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms \\nDiemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor \\ntraining frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, \\ncall centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers \\nthrowing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay \\nfor training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a \\ncustomer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just \\n50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a \\nspecialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well \\nbelow the industry target of an 85% resolution rate. \\n \\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost \\ncountries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont \\nsays. \\n \\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between \\ncall centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing \\ncountries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere \\nif you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. \\nHowever, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven \\nnot just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money \\nis the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. \\nHalf of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills \\nfor the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring \\nare the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey \\nhave no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons \\nfor not making the move: \\n \\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\",  \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad,  \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the \\noffshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of \\nDimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call \\ncentres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences \\nwith call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or \\ndo you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did \\nyour training prepare you for your job? \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nNovartis hits acquisition trail \\n \\nSwiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£3.9bn) of \\npurchases to make its Sandoz unit the world\\'s biggest generic drug \\nproducer. \\n \\nNovartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had \\nbought all of Germany\\'s Hexal. It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal\\'s US \\naffiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. \\nNovartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a \\nyear following the acquisitions. Novartis\\' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss \\nfrancs in early trading. \\n \\nThe deal will see Novartis\\' Sandoz business overtake Israel\\'s Teva \\nPharmaceuticals as the world\\'s biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 \\nfigures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the \\ncompany estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of \\ndepartments, adding that there may be job cuts. \\n \\n\"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is \\nexpected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work \\nforce,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically \\nidentical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as \\nSandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent \\nprotection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to \\npay research and development cost. \\n \\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have \\npredicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However, \\nnot all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. \"This is a very \\nexpensive acquisition,\" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment \\nbank, told Reuters. \"I find it strange that they are making acquisitions \\nin exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nEconomy \\'strong\\' in election year \\n \\nUK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this \\ncould trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. \\n \\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits \\nof a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy \\nHayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week \\n- but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after \\nthe anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a \\nleading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to \\n102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in \\npublic spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. \\n \\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be \\nuncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s \\noutput index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - \\nremained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second \\nquarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent \\ninterest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil \\nprices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen \\ncontinuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from \\n108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the \\ngeneral election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt \\nahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary \\npressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth \\nwill probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see \\nhigher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and \\nservices.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSluggish economy hits German jobs \\n \\nThe number of people out of work in Europe\\'s largest economy has risen \\nfor the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow. \\n \\nGerman unemployment rose 7,000 in November to 4.464 million people, or \\n10.8% of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller \\nrise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation \\nbegan to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still \\nstifling the job market. \"There are clear signs of a revival in domestic \\ndemand,\" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in \\na statement. \"But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still \\ninsufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.\" High oil \\nprices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of \\nexporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the \\nunemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where \\nthe rate is 18.8%. \\n \\nWith unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of \\nChancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the \\nagenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get \\nback to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked \\nanger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, \\nnotably among the country\\'s iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the \\ndispleasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing \\ntakes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called \"one-euro jobs\" \\nwhich top up unemployment benefit. The scheme\\'s formal launch is January, \\nbut hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting \\nthe unemployment statistics, economists said. \"The deterioration of the \\nlabour market does not come as a surprise,\" said Isabelle Kronawitter at \\nHypovereinsbank. \"Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger \\nincrease in the seasonally adjusted numbers.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSales \\'fail to boost High Street\\' \\n \\nThe January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a \\npoor Christmas season, a survey has found. \\n \\nStores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to \\nDecember levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. \\nSales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-\\nlike basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over \\nbuying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin \\nHawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market \\ncontinue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. But \\nclothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than \\nDecember, while department stores also had a good month. \\n \\nIn the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate \\nof -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. \\n\"Following a relatively strong New Year\\'s bank holiday, trading then took \\na downward turn,\" said Mr Hawkins. \"Even extending some promotions and \\ndiscounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt \\ncustomers.\" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst \\nfor 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National \\nStatistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by \\nsome counts were the worst since 1981. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCall to save manufacturing jobs \\n \\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job \\nlosses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies. \\n \\nThe TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed \\nbecause of 105,000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year. It calls \\nfor better pensions, child care provision and decent wages. The 36-page \\nsubmission also urges the government to examine support other European \\ncountries provide to industry. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber \\ncalled for \"a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to \\nthe lives of working people.\" \\n \\n\"Greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering \\nthat childcare will increases the options available to working parents,\" \\nhe said. \"A commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector \\nensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the \\nfrontline services that this country needs.\" He also called for \\n\"practical measures\" to help pensioners, especially women who he said \\n\"are most likely to retire in poverty\". The submission also calls for \\ndecent wages and training for people working in the manufacturing sector. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBat spit drug firm goes to market \\n \\nA German firm whose main product is derived from the saliva of the \\nvampire bat is looking to raise more than 70m euros ($91m; Â£49m) on the \\nstock market. \\n \\nThe firm, Paion, said that it hoped to sell 5 million shares - a third of \\nthe firm - for 11-14 euros a share. Its main drug, desmoteplase, is based \\non a protein in the bat\\'s saliva. The protein stops blood from clotting - \\nwhich helps the bat to drink from its victims, but could also be used to \\nhelp stroke sufferers. The company\\'s shares go on sale later this week, \\nand are scheduled to start trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 10 \\nFebruary. If the final price is at the top of the range, the company \\ncould be valued at as much as 200m euros. The money raised will be spent \\nlargely on developing the company\\'s other drugs, since desmoteplase has \\nalready been licensed to one manufacturer, Forest Laboratories. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFirms pump billions into pensions \\n \\nEmployers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary \\npensions over the past year, research suggests. \\n \\nA survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services\\' (IDS) said employer \\ncontributions had increased from Â£5.5bn to Â£8.2bn a year, a rise of \\n49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension \\ncontributions by 100% or more, IDS said. Many firms are struggling to \\nkeep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased \\nliabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit \\nscheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member \\nis earning when they retire. \\n \\nThe rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to \\nreplace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined \\ncontribution, schemes. These are less risky for employers. Under money \\npurchase schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy \\nan annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on \\nretirement. \\n \\nIDS said there were some schemes in good health. \\n \\nBut, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle \\n\"yawning deficits\". The level of contributions paid by employers has \\nincreased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, \\ncontributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between \\n1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels. Helen \\nSudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in \\ncontributions was \"staggering\" and the highest ever recorded by IDS. \"We \\nhave warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to \\nnew entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from \\npaternalistic provision,\" said Ms Sudell. \"With figures like this there \\ncan be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future \\nbenefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK homes hit Â£3.3 trillion total \\n \\nThe value of the UK\\'s housing stock reached the Â£3.3 trillion mark in \\n2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates. \\n \\nResearch from Halifax, the country\\'s biggest mortgage lender, suggests \\nthe value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily. All \\nregions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade. \\nBut Northern Ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while Scotland saw the \\nsmallest increase of just 112%. \\n \\nThe core retail price index rose by just 28% in the same period, \\nunderlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most \\npeople during the past decade. More than a third of the UK\\'s private \\nhousing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are \\nconcentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax\\'s figures \\nindicate. Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: \"The value of \\nthe private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, \\nby a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households \\nin the UK.\" Halifax\\'s own monthly figures on house sales - issued on \\nThursday - suggest the average price of a British property now stands at \\nÂ£163,748 after a 0.8% rise in January. Housing experts are split on \\nprospects for the market, with some saying price growth will slow but not \\nfall, while others predict a sharp drop in values. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMarket unfazed by Aurora setback \\n \\nAs the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos \\nand interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. \\n \\nThe ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health \\nscares and technical trouble. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of \\nthe huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice \\nchopped off this year\\'s profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, \\nhowever, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent \\nhit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world\\'s biggest \\ninvestment banks had upped its target for Carnival\\'s share price, from \\nÂ£35 to Â£36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT \\nCarnival\\'s shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at \\nÂ£32.26. \\n \\nWhy the mismatch between the public perception and the market\\'s response? \\n\"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche \\nBank\\'s Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the \\ncompany - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very \\ngood at treating these issues as one-off events.\" \\n \\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel \\nin a large Carnival fleet, the UK\\'s P&O Princess group having been merged \\ninto the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival \\nhas a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival \\nhas an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion. \\n \\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business \\nto be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had \\nto give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora \\nhave got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should \\nmitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, \\nRoyal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons \\nare not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup \\nSmith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events \\ntypically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future \\ncruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but \\nfor Carnival customers elsewhere it\\'s unlikely to make too much of a \\nsplash. \\n \\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure \\nof the industry also works in Carnival\\'s favour. In the wake of P&O \\nPrincess\\'s takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a \\nduopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise \\nship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at \\nMerrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your \\noptions are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it \\nlooks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the \\nill-fated Aurora in the future. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGlaxo aims high after profit fall \\n \\nGlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to Â£6.2bn ($11.5bn), \\nbut Europe\\'s biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way. \\n \\nCheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and \\nWellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up \\n1% in 2004. The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver \\nprofits despite the failure of an obesity drug. Chief executive Jean-\\nPierre Garnier said it had been a \"difficult year\". \\n \\nIn early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at \\n1218 pence. Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over Â£1.5bn of lost \\nsales to generics but still managing to grow the business. \"The \\ncontinuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a \\ngood performance in 2005,\" he said. \"2005 will also be an important year \\nin terms of research and development pipeline progress.\" However, the \\nfirm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, \\nknown as \\'771, after disappointing clinical trial results. Glaxo is \\nrelying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, \\ndepression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after \\nseveral disappointing years. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRenault boss hails \\'great year\\' \\n \\nStrong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by \\nmore than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this \\nyear. \\n \\nFrance\\'s second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net \\nprofits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; Â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn \\neuros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good \\nperformance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis \\nSchweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm. \\n \\nRenault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on \\nthe previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with \\nparticularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa. \\n \\nIn total, sales outside western Europe - Renault\\'s core market - rose \\n16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - \\ncontributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman \\nCarlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later \\nthis year. \\n \\nRenault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was \\n\"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will \\nbenefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the \\nroll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected \\noperating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \\n\"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw \\nmaterial prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" \\nthe company said in a statement. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSafety alert as GM recalls cars \\n \\nThe world\\'s biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly \\n200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal \\nregulators. \\n \\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the \\nlargest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles \\n(SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking \\nsystems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 \\nand 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are \\nthe Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC \\nSavana, Sierra and Yukon. \\n \\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack \\nduring normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was \\nopen. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it \\nharder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also \\nrecalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix \\nsedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal \\nmay not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more \\nbraking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, \\nChevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 \\nmodel years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall \\nout in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries \\nrelated to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last \\nmonth that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The \\nworld\\'s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European \\nbusiness, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said \\nhigher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its \\nfinancial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nAsian quake hits European shares \\n \\nShares in Europe\\'s leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the \\nscale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become \\napparent. \\n \\nMore than 23,000 people have been killed following a massive underwater \\nearthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist \\ndestinations. Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value \\nas investors worried about rebuilding costs. But the disaster has little \\nimpact on stock markets in the US and Asia. \\n \\nCurrencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as \\nanalysts warned that economic growth may slow. \"It came at the worst \\npossible time,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. \"The \\nimpact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in \\nThailand.\" Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such \\nas Germany\\'s TUI and Lufthansa and France\\'s Club Mediterranne sliding. \\nInsurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe. \\n \\nShares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers - \\nboth fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in \\nAsia. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. \\n \\nHowever, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market\\'s view \\nthat reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. Worries \\nabout the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, \\nalthough the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. \\nGermany\\'s benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at \\n3.817.69 while France\\'s Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to \\n3.817.69. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be \\nindustry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. \"It\\'s \\nstill too early for concrete damage figures,\" Swiss Re\\'s spokesman \\nFloiran Woest told Associated Press. \"That also has to do with the fact \\nthat the damage is very widely spread geographically.\" \\n \\nThe unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate \\nimpact on US shares, however. The Dow Jones index had risen 20.54 points, \\nor 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more \\nencouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales. In Asian \\nmarkets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and \\nthe cost of repairs. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. The country relies on \\ntourism for about 6% of its total economy. Singapore Airlines dropped \\n2.6%. About 5% of Singapore\\'s annual gross domestic product (GDP) comes \\nfrom tourism. Malaysia\\'s budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort \\noperator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%. \\n \\nTravel companies also took a hit, with Japan\\'s Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% \\nand HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia\\'s largest \\nstock market, Japan\\'s Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. \\nConcerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on \\nthe currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against \\nthe US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai \\nbaht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where \\nmore than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% \\nagainst the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the \\ntotal cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies \\nwould come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil prices reach three-month low \\n \\nOil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month \\nlows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. \\n \\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having \\ndived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light \\ncrude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close \\nsince 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in \\ntwo days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information \\nAdministration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% \\nhigher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. \\nWeak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in \\npushing up oil prices. \"It\\'s amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said \\nRick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also \\nattributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered \\ndemand for heating oil. \\n \\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month \\nhighs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those \\ngains by the end of Thursday. \\n \\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-\\nawaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters \\nover the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. \\nHowever, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a \\ncold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in \\nother parts of the world. \\n \\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has \\nfallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have \\nincreased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has \\nhelped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan \\nin September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from \\nthe energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel \\nwas likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, \\nsome analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec\\'s \\nattitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. \\n \\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are \\nrising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America \\nwould start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. \\nAnalysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue \\nto rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" \\nsaid Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we\\'re \\nheaded to $30-35 but I don\\'t think we\\'re doing that yet. We have a lot of \\nwinter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory \\nServices, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies \\nfor the next three months in the US. . \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMarkets fall on weak dollar fears \\n \\nRising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a \\nfinance ministers\\' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan. \\n \\nThe London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo\\'s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its \\nsteepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about \\nsupporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in \\nJapan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop \\nfunding the US deficit. \\n \\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the \\ndollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors \\nfretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output \\ncut from oil producers\\' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end \\nof the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 \\ncents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 \\ncents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting \\nto talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy. \\n \\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told \\nthe Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he \\nremained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn \\ntrade gap, the red ink spreading across America\\'s public finances is \\nwidely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US \\nTreasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy \\nremained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the \\nmarkets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some \\nhad looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear \\nexchange rates had not been on the agenda. \\n \\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term \\nfix. \\n \\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. \\nIn the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising \\nan $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 \\ntrillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan \\nGreenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. \\nAt present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds \\nto Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the \\nworld\\'s reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the \\ngap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole \\nspends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an \\nauction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that \\ncould turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the \\nvalue of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of \\nthe US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to \\ndollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFive million Germans out of work \\n \\nGermany\\'s unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important \\nlevel of five million last month. \\n \\nOn Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had \\nreached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. \\n\"Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,\" a \\ngovernment minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment \\nhas not been this high in Germany since the 1930s. \\n \\nChanges to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of \\n572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the \\ngovernment. \"With the figures apparently the worst we\\'ve seen in the \\npost-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,\" said \\nChristian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could well put \\nan end to the recent renaissance we\\'ve seen by the SPD [the ruling Social \\nDemocrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-\\nHolstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on \\nthe government\\'s chances there.\" \\n \\nThe opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said \\nthere are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment \\nschemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government \\nreforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under \\nthe government\\'s controversial \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which came into effect \\nat the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and \\nwelfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially \\nclassified as looking for work. The bad winter weather also took its \\ntoll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. \\nAdjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by \\n227,000 in January from December. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman bidder in talks with LSE \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and \\nfriendly\" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said. \\n \\nWerner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the \\nGerman group may raise its bid to Â£1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial \\nÂ£1.3bn offer. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the \\nbid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European \\nbourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based \\nexchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise \\nÂ£1.4bn to fund a bid. \\n \\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE \\nsince its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London \\nexchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to \\nleave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-\\nimproved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s shareholders and \\ncustomers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam \\nand Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement \\non Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but \\nadded that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will \\nbe made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market \\noperator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York \\nStock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the \\nLSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away. \\n \\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. \\nAmong sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms \\nFurse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives \\nmarket to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, \\nHans Reckers, a board member of Germany\\'s central bank, the Bundesbank, \\nsaid that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something \\nDeutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of \\nthe Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently \\nin Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of \\nthe banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in \\nFrankfurt\\'s state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is \\nour wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt\\'s standing \\nas the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, \\nits minister for economic affairs added. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nAmex shares up on spin-off news \\n \\nShares in American Express surged more than 8% on Tuesday after it said \\nit was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary. \\n \\nThe US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American \\nExpress Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability. AEFA has \\nmore than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance \\nto 2.5 million customers. Over the years it has delivered poor profits \\nand even some losses. \\n \\n\"This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core \\nbusinesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for \\nquite some time,\" said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain. \\nAnalysts estimate that a stand-alone AEFA could have a market value of \\n$10bn (Â£5.3bn). The unit was acquired by American Express 20 years ago \\nas Investors Diversified Service, of Minneapolis, at a time when firms \\nwere amassing one-stop financial empires. However, the business of \\nselling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nStock market eyes Japan recovery \\n \\nJapanese shares have ended the year at their highest level since 13 July \\namidst hopes of an economic recovery during 2005. \\n \\nThe Nikkei index of leading shares gained 7.6% during the year to close \\nat 11,488.76 points. In 2005 it \"will rise toward 13,000\", predicted \\nMorgan Stanley equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. The optimism in the \\nfinancial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese \\nbusiness community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of \\nJapanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for \\nthe first time since March 2003. \\n \\nSlower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker \\nexports were blamed for the fall in confidence. Despite this, traders \\nexpect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan, which has been \\nclose to sliding into recession in recent months. Structural reform \\nwithin Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector\\'s bad debt \\nproblems should also help, they say. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIraqi voters turn to economic issues \\n \\nBeyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in \\ntatters. \\n \\nA vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has \\nbeen made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an \\nelected government will break the deadlock. \"First rule of law, then the \\neconomy,\" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based \\noil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq \\nin 2003. Mr Hadi\\'s view about what the new government\\'s priorities should \\nbe is shared by many Iraqis. The economy has become the second-most \\ndominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday\\'s election, \\naccording to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who \\nis working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war \\nIraq. \\n \\nJob creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi \\npeople\\'s wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, \\nbut it is clear that the situation is dire. \"Estimates of Iraq\\'s \\nunemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,\" the \\nWashington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in \\nits Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the \\ncountry\\'s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. \\n \\nIraq\\'s infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having \\nbeen made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone \\nnetworks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and \\nthe growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One \\nIraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV \\nadverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down \\nbasic medicines from Baghdad\\'s pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: \"The economy \\nat present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\" \\nAn indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in \\ncontrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks \\noperate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking \\nprinciples. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks \\nhave been buying into the sector. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a \\nmajority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank \\nExport & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq. \\n \\nForeign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. \\nBechtel\\'s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted \\ncontroversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has \\nenjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign \\nfirms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with \\nmany Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for \\nfunctions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms \\nAlexander. \"It is seen as a selling off of Iraq\\'s assets and bringing in \\nmultinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,\" she \\nsays. Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to \\nbacktrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign \\nownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. In the West, it is easy to \\nforget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the \\nmajority of Iraq\\'s citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social \\nsecurity and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that \"people still want \\nthe state to take a leading role in providing these things\", Ms Alexander \\nsays. \\n \\nYet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly \\nwelcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades \\nago. \"I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" Mr Hadi \\nsays. \"Iraq\\'s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of \\neconomic growth.\" \\n \\nMany foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few \\nare actually entering the country in any meaningful way. But there are \\nexceptions. Mr Hadi\\'s Blackwatch is just one of many small operators \\npreparing for a much bigger future. Blackwatch\\'s Baghdad-based affiliate \\nFalcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in \\nKirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the \\nIraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi \\npoints out. \"These guys are trying to work. The Iraqi business people \\nwill do business at all times. \"Life goes on in Iraq, the people take \\nresponsibility, they want to live normal lives.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nPeugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi \\n \\nStruggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to \\nsupply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles \\n(SUV). \\n \\nThe two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect \\nto seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-\\nneeded boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings \\nand poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot\\'s diesel \\nengines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left \\nMitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with \\nPeugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it. \\n \\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine \\nmonths, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales \\nhave slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the \\ncompany had systematically been hiding records of faults and then \\nsecretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has \\nsought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking \\nfor a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; Â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, \\nhalf of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German \\ncarmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided \\nin April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was \\ncelebrated by Mitsubishi\\'s newly-appointed chief executive Takashi \\nNishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to \\nshoulder responsibility for the firm\\'s troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has \\nforecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March \\n2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival \\nNissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It \\nhas been making cars for Nissan since 2003. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChina continues breakneck growth \\n \\nChina\\'s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than \\npredicted and well above 2003\\'s 9.1%. \\n \\nThe news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries \\nto take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and \\nenergy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the \\nrest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that \\nindustrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the \\nimpetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government \\nefforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, \\ndown from 17% the previous year. \\n \\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to \\nconcern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke \\ninflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up \\n21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen \\nin the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. \\nChina raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in \\nnine years - in October 2004. \\n \\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth \\npicture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown \\nin 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. \\n \\nChina\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, \\nbut also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year \\nshowed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus \\ncomes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The \\ngovernment keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - \\nmuch to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs \\nand competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist \\nthey are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \\n\"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs \\ntime,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those \\nwho hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will \\nnot succeed in making a profit.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapan\\'s ageing workforce: built to last \\n \\nIn his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to \\nrun his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And \\nthe 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every \\nday throughout his life. \\n \\nMr Toshitsune is one of Japan\\'s 23,000 centenarians - a club that is \\ngrowing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At his neat \\nOsaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian \\ndaughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist \\nsutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between \\ntasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal \\nis: \"Well, what\\'s most important for me is to be Japan\\'s number one.\" Mr \\nToshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, \\nJapan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to \\nlive until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and \\nEuropeans. \\n \\nOn the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this \\nphenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in \\ntheir seventies. \\n \\n\"I think this is because the food industry and the environment have \\nimproved,\" he remarks. \"On average, we can live longer.\" Whether it\\'s the \\ndiet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly \\ndefined, or just something in the genes, Japan\\'s elderly are remarkable. \\nBut while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren \\nhave huge problems ahead. Japan is the world\\'s least fertile nation with \\nchildbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. \\n \\nBy 2007, Japan\\'s population is expected to peak at 127 million, then \\nshrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 \\nmillion fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have \\nalmost doubled. \\n \\n\"In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will \\nmake up over 30% of the population,\" explains Shigeo Morioka of the \\nInternational Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan\\'s finances \\nstay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit \\nspending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country\\'s \\ngross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised \\ncountries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling \\nbirth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan\\'s welfare \\nstate will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances \\nwill deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly \\nprepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of \\nDeutsche Securities Japan, asks; \"Who\\'s going to fund the pension fund \\nfor the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese \\nworker? \"Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the \\nleaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?\" One \\noption is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from \\nthe Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears \\nrestricted to a limited number of nursing staff. \\n \\nStanding next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York\\'s Statue of \\nLiberty. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island. \\n \\n\"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it\\'s \\nan option that\\'s becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists \\nMr Wood. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, \\nimmigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the Japanese economy, \\nfacing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, \\nhi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash. \\n \\nOf course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is \\ncurrently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar \\nto those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until \\n2030, when today\\'s babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like \\nin Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan - and of course \\nthe European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to \\n420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must \\nre-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America\\'s \\nover 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current \\naccount balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. \\n \\nSome voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the \\nnature of the Japanese labour market. They want a shift towards financial \\nservices, though doubts persist over the country\\'s ability, let alone \\nwillingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"Japan still has problems \\ngetting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business \\nor their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing \\nbusiness overseas,\" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical \\nreforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling \\ndemand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and \\na basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a \\nshrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears \\nthat the world\\'s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. \\nBut none of this is Mr Toshitsune\\'s concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles \\nthat, he feels fine. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK economy facing \\'major risks\\' \\n \\nThe UK manufacturing sector will continue to face \"serious challenges\" \\nover the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said. \\n \\nThe group\\'s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in \\nthe last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. The \\nrise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. However, \\nthe BCC found the whole UK economy still faced \"major risks\" and warned \\nthat growth is set to slow. It recently forecast economic growth will \\nslow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and \\n2006. \\n \\nManufacturers\\' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, \\nthe survey of 5,196 firms found. Employment in manufacturing also fell \\nand job expectations were at their lowest level for a year. \\n \\n\"Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying \\nsigns for manufacturing,\" the BCC said. \"These results reinforce our \\nconcern over the sector\\'s persistent inability to sustain recovery.\" The \\noutlook for the service sector was \"uncertain\" despite an increase in \\nexports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted. \\n \\nThe BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the \\nmanufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the \\nlevels at the start of 2004. The reduced threat of interest rate \\nincreases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. The Bank of \\nEngland raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August \\nlast year. But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of \\nfalling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. \"The pressure on \\ncosts and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat \\nof higher taxes remain serious problems,\" BCC director general David \\nFrost said. \"While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly \\nover the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports \\nwill rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSteady job growth continues in US \\n \\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said \\nthat the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world\\'s biggest \\neconomy. \\n \\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last \\nmonth. That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five \\nyears. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US \\neconomy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady \\ngrowth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in \\nDecember, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if \\nthat figure is to drop. \\n \\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa \\nSecurities. \\n \\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus \\nforecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an \\nincrease in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area \\nof the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication \\nthat the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal \\nReserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The \\nFed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence \\nthe US economic recovery was becoming more robust. \\n \\nJob creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and \\nproved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. \\nWhile demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for \\nsteady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it \\njust keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" \\nin 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, \\neconomists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal \\nReserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A \\nfall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US \\neconomic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest \\nrate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a \\nfall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, \\nwhile noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDutch bank to lay off 2,850 staff \\n \\nABN Amro, the Netherlands\\' largest bank, is to cut 2,850 jobs as a result \\nof falling profits. \\n \\nThe cuts - amounting to 3% of the bank\\'s workforce - will result in a \\none-off charge of 790m euros ($1.1bn). About 1,100 jobs will go in \\ninvestment banking while 1,200 and 550 will go in IT and human resources \\nrespectively. ABN Amro is the third large European bank to announce \\ncutbacks in the past month following Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse \\nGroup. \\n \\nIts profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the \\nUnited States - the bank\\'s largest single market - following recent \\ninterest rate rises. ABN Amro\\'s operations in the Netherlands and the \\nUnited Kingdom will be hardest hit. Jobs will also be lost in the US - \\nwhich accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across \\nits operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. \\n \\nThe restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing \\nadministrative costs and increasing focus on client service. The bank \\nsaid it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but \\noperating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues. ABN \\nAmro currently has more than 100,000 staff. \"To get any profit growth in \\nthe coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes \\ntotal sense,\" Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told \\nBloomberg. Europe\\'s leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment. \\nDeutsche Bank said earlier this month it would reduce its German \\nworkforce by 1,920 while as many as 300 jobs will be lost at Credit \\nSuisse First Boston. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nFannie Mae \\'should restate books\\' \\n \\nUS mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that \\nis likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have \\nsaid. \\n \\nThe Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using \\ntechniques that \"did not comply in material respects\" with accounting \\nstandards. Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. \\nThe other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn \\n(Â£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. The SEC\\'s comments are \\nlikely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of \\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \\n \\nThe two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively \\nunderwrite the mortgage market, financing nearly half of all American \\nhouse purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial \\ninstruments. The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked \\nconcerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks \\nover the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight \\n(OFHEO), the industry\\'s main regulator. Having been pricked into action, \\nthe OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year \\nsaid that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly \\nacross quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. The SEC \\nfound similar problems. The watchdog\\'s chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen \\nsaid that \"Fannie Mae\\'s methodology of assessing, measuring and \\ndocumenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported\" \\nby generally accepted accounting principles. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSoaring oil \\'hits world economy\\' \\n \\nThe soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world\\'s \\nmajor economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the \\nOECD. \\n \\nIn its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for \\nthe world\\'s main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in \\n2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the \\nOECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed \\nthe global economy could still regain momentum. \\n \\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% \\nthis year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the \\n12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping \\nto 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. \\nOverall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 \\nmember countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before \\nrecovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to \\nbelieve that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will \\nregain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, \\nthe OECD\\'s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than \\nit was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in \\nlate October. \\n \\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer \\nconfidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by \\nhistorical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil \\nprice does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed \\nwithin the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the \\nOECD, told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was \\nunderway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, \\nwould then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\'s booming \\neconomy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has \\nfaltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD \\nsaid. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery \\nof business investment should continue in North America and start in \\nearnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to \\nbe seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role \\nthrough a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted \\ncurrent depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\'s \\nover-reliance on export-led growth. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nStormy year for property insurers \\n \\nA string of storms, typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most \\nexpensive year on record for property insurers, according to Swiss Re. \\n \\nThe world\\'s second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have \\nseen property claims reach $42bn (Â£21.5bn). \"2004 reinforces the trend \\ntowards higher losses,\" said Swiss Re. Tightly packed populations in the \\nareas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame \\nfor the rise in claims, it said. Some 95% of insurance claims were for \\nnatural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events. \\n \\nThe largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, \\nand Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for \\ndecades plus a major earthquake. \\n \\nEurope suffered fewer natural disasters, but 191 people were killed and \\nmore than 2,000 injured in March after the terrorist attack on train \\nstations in Madrid. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, \\nincluding 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. \\nSwiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters \\naround the world in 2004. Twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in \\nthe catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn \\n(Â£54bn). \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChristmas shoppers flock to tills \\n \\nShops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before \\nChristmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers. \\n \\nA spokesman for Manchester\\'s Trafford Centre said it was \"the biggest \\nChristmas to date\" with sales up 5%. And the Regent Street Association \\nsaid shops in central London were also expecting the \"best Christmas \\never\". That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales \\nin the last couple of weeks. \\n \\nThe Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had \\narrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT. \"We predict that the \\nnext week will continue the same trend,\" she added. \\n \\nIt was a similar story at Bluewater in Kent. Spokesman Alan Jones said he \\nexpected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of Saturday and a \\nfurther 100,000 on Sunday. \"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same \\ntime last year,\" he said. \"We\\'re very busy, it\\'s really strong and people \\nwill be shopping right up until Christmas. \"Over the Christmas period \\nwe\\'re expecting people to spend in excess of Â£200m at the centre.\" \\n \\nOn Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David\\'s Shopping Centre \\nin Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with \\nabout 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. At \\nthe St Enoch\\'s Shopping Centre in Glasgow, more than 140,000 shoppers - \\nan all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by \\nits closing time of 1900 GMT. Senior business manager Jon Walton said: \\n\"It has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed. \"Every week footfall has \\nbeen showing strong growth and at the weekends it has been going mad.\" \\nRegent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: \"The \\nstores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last \\nminute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the \\nweek.\" \\n \\nShe said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the \\ngrowing popularity of internet sales. \"I do think this has had a lot to \\ndo with reports of lower sales figures,\" she said. \"Internet shopping has \\ngone up enormously and not all stores have websites.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDiageo to buy US wine firm \\n \\nDiageo, the world\\'s biggest spirits company, has agreed to buy \\nCalifornian wine company Chalone for $260m (Â£134m) in an all-cash deal. \\n \\nAlthough Diageo\\'s best-known brands include Smirnoff vodka and Guinness \\nstout, it already has a US winemaking arm - Diageo Chateau & Estate \\nWines. Diageo said it expects to get US regulatory approval for the deal \\nduring the first quarter of 2005. It said Chalone would be integrated \\ninto its existing US wine business. \\n \\n\"The US wine market represents a growth opportunity for Diageo, with \\nfavourable demographic and consumption trends,\" said Diageo North America \\npresident Ivan Menezes. In July, Diageo, which is listed on the London \\nStock Exchange, reported an annual turnover of Â£8.89bn, down from \\nÂ£9.28bn a year earlier. It blamed a weaker dollar for its lower \\nturnover. In the year ending 31 December 2003, Chalone reported revenues \\nof $69.4m. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS adds more jobs than expected \\n \\nThe US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far \\nmore than Wall Street expectations. \\n \\nIn a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, \\nthe Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. \\nJobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. \\nWhile the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in \\nSeptember, this was because more people were now actively seeking work. \\n \\nThe 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the \\n169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, the \\nLabor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two \\nprevious months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to \\n198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data \\nhad an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow \\nJones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. \"It \\nlooks like the job situation is improving and that this will support \\nconsumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag \\ncaused by high oil prices this year,\" said economist Gary Thayer of AG \\nEdwards & Sons. \\n \\nOther analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US \\nFederal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a \\npercentage point to 2% when it meets next week. \"It should empower the \\nFed to clearly do something,\" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with \\nEaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the \\nBureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in \\nOctober were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and \\nneighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and \\nSeptember. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before \\nfalling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned \\ntheir attention to other economic factors, such as the US\\'s record trade \\ndeficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately \\ntry to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIndy buys into India paper \\n \\nIrish publishing group Independent News & Media is buying up a 26% stake \\nin Indian newspaper company Jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m). \\n \\nJagran publishes India\\'s top-selling daily newspaper, the Hindi-language \\nDainik Jagran, which has been in circulation for 62 years. News of the \\ndeal came as the group announced that its results would meet market \\nforecasts. The company reported strong revenue growth across all its \\nmajor markets. \\n \\nGroup advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year, the group said, \\nwith overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% \\nyear-on-year. This was helped by the positive impact of \"compact\" \\nnewspaper editions in Ireland and the UK, it said. \"2004 has proven to be \\nan important year for Independent News & Media,\" said chief executive Sir \\nAnthony O\\'Reilly. \"Our simple aim at Independent is to be the low cost \\nproducer in every region in which we operate. I am confident that we will \\nshow a meaningful increase in earnings for 2005.\" \\n \\nMeanwhile, the group made no comment about the future of the Independent \\nnewspaper despite recent speculation that Sir Anthony had held talks with \\npotential buyers over a stake in the daily publication. He has \\nconsistently denied suggestions that the Independent and the Independent \\non Sunday are up for sale. Buy it is understood that the recent success \\nof the smaller edition of the Independent, which has pushed circulation \\nup by 20% to 260,000, has prompted interest from industry rivals, with \\nDaily Mail & General Trust tipped as the most likely suitor. The loss-\\nmaking newspaper is not expected to reach break-even until 2006. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nHouse prices drop as sales slow \\n \\nHouse prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened \\nas rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors \\nfound. \\n \\nA total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices \\nin the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. \\nMeanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per \\nsurveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the \\nsixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown \\noccurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but \\nthis time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman \\nIan Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase \\ninterest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to \\nconsolidate.\" \\n \\nThe figures support recent data from the government and other bodies \\nwhich all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the \\nCouncil of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building \\nSocieties Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures \\nwere published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the \\naverage asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in \\nNovember to Â£189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South \\nsaw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than \\nthe national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward \\npath, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to \\ndent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at \\ntheir most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised \\ndespite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year \\nand I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added. \\nLooking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the \\nmarket picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over \\nthe coming 12 months. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBanker loses sexism claim \\n \\nA former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her \\nÂ£7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank. \\n \\nAn employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba\\'s allegations of \\nsexual discrimination and unequal pay. But the 42-year-old won her claim \\nof unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her \\npartial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about Â£55,000, a \\ntiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be \\nassessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an \\nemployment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test \\ncase. \\n \\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed \\nbecause, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait \\nto see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the \\norganisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill\\'s private client \\nbusiness in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. \\n \\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very \\ndisappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill\\'s procedures \\nwithin the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba\\'s claim of \\nvictimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in \\nconnection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish \\nculture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about \\nperformance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was \\nremoved by the very same person who had promoted her into the position \\nand who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated \\nto creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity \\nto advance based on their skills and hard work.\" \\n \\nBased in London\\'s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill\\'s \\nglobal private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of \\nMerrill\\'s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her \\nshe had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made \\nredundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba\\'s claims and said she was \\nremoved from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was \\nsuffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms \\nVillalba\\'s division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms \\nVillalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRover deal \\'may cost 2,000 jobs\\' \\n \\nSome 2,000 jobs at MG Rover\\'s Midlands plant may be cut if investment in \\nthe firm by a Chinese car maker goes ahead, the Financial Times has \\nreported. \\n \\nShanghai Automotive Industry Corp plans to shift production of the Rover \\n25 to China and export it to the UK, sources close to the negotiations \\ntell the FT. But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were \\n\"speculation\". A tie-up, seen as Rover\\'s last chance to save its \\nLongbridge plant, has been pushed by UK Chancellor Gordon Brown. Rover \\nconfirmed the tie-up would take place \"not very far away from this time\". \\n \\nRover bosses have said they are \"confident\" the Â£1bn ($1.9bn) investment \\ndeal would be signed in March or early April. \\n \\nTransport & General Worker\\'s Union general secretary Tony Woodley \\nrepeated his view on Friday that all mergers led to some job cuts. He \\nsaid investment in new models was needed to ensure the future of the \\nBirmingham plant. \"This is a very crucial and delicate time and our \\nefforts are targeted to securing new models for the company which will \\nmean jobs for our people,\" he said. SAIC says none of its money will be \\npaid to the four owners of Rover, who have been accused by unions of \\nawarding themselves exorbitant salaries, the FT reports. \"SAIC is \\nextremely concerned to ensure that its money is used to invest in the \\nbusiness rather than be distributed to the shareholders,\" the newspaper \\nquotes a source close to the Chinese firm. Meanwhile, according to \\nChinese state press reports, small state-owned carmaker Nanjing Auto is \\nin negotiations with Rover and SAIC to take a 20% stake in the joint \\nventure.

But now its banks have agreed to \\nextend its credit facilities until March 2006. \\n \\nThe company also said it had agreed terms over the completion of 14 of \\nits biggest construction projects under the government\\'s Private Finance \\nInitiative (PFI). \\n \\nJarvis wants to scale back the division, which has proved too costly and \\nhas been blamed for many of its problems. Instead, it plans to focus on \\nUK rail renewal, roads and plant hire work. Madrid-based Ferrovial \\nalready holds a 33% stake in Tube Lines, which maintains the Jubilee, \\nNorthern and Piccadilly lines. The Spanish group has been keen to snap up \\nmore UK infrastructure assets, having bought Amey in 2003. Jarvis said \\nthe sale, which raked in more than the Â£100m analysts had expected, \\nwould \"substantially\" enhance its financial position. \"I am now confident \\nthat we can now move forward in 2005 towards rebuilding Jarvis and return \\nit to growth as a profitable business,\" said chief executive Alan Lovell. \\nShares in Jarvis were up more than 16% to 18 pence by the close of trade \\non Friday. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBattered dollar hits another low \\n \\nThe dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data \\nfuelled fresh concerns about the US economy. \\n \\nThe greenback hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to \\n$1.3509. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded \\nabout $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and \\nbudget deficits. Meanwhile, France\\'s finance minister has said the world \\nfaced \"economic catastrophe\" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on \\ncurrency controls. Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue \\nat the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European \\nand Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the \\ndollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to \\nhurt their export-driven economies. \"It\\'s absolutely essential that at \\nthe meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need \\ncoordinated management at the world level,\" said Mr Gaymard. \\n \\nThursday\\'s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing \\nyear-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - \\nwith some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer \\nactivity. \\n \\nCommerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two \\nthirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The figure was \\nweaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The \\nofficial US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market \\nobservers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost \\nto its exporters. \\n \\nThe US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which \\nhave publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \\n\"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002. The US says it will let \\nmarket forces determine the dollar\\'s strength rather than intervene \\ndirectly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his \\naim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the \\ncurrency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had \\nexacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend \\nremains downwards. The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year \\nand analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, \\nin 2005. \"I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see \\nthat it\\'s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, \\nfinishing the year around $1.40,\" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist \\nwith HSBC in London. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDisaster claims \\'less than $10bn\\' \\n \\nInsurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an \\nearthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern \\nAsia. \\n \\nMunich Re and Swiss Re, the world\\'s two biggest reinsurers, have said \\nexposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are \\nlikely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those \\naffected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re has said total \\nclaims are likely to be less than $10bn (Â£5.17bn). Swiss Re believes \\nthat the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in \\ndouble-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the \\nworld\\'s largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than \\n100m euros (Â£70m; $136m). \\n \\nAt least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, \\nIndia and Thailand among the worst hit. The region\\'s resorts and Western \\ntourists are expected to be among the main claimants. \\n \\nLloyds of London told the Financial Times it expected its exposure to be \\nlimited to \"holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and \\nmarine risks\". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe\\'s fifth-largest \\nreinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the \\nlow double-digit millions of euros. The company has paid out about 300 \\nmillion euros (Â£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four \\nmajor hurricanes in the US. \\n \\nBut insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the \\ndamage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming \\nthrough. \\n \\n\"So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,\" said Serge \\nTroeber, deputy head of Swiss Re\\'s natural disasters department. \"You \\nneed very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike the \\nhurricanes, you can\\'t just run a model.\" He anticipated that his own \\ncompany\\'s total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, \\nwhich the company put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said \\nit did not know yet what its exposure would be. However, it said the \\ntidal waves were unlikely to have a \"significant\" impact on its business. \\nZurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. \\n \\nThe impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, \\nanalysts said. \\n \\nMost US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that \\ndo, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special \\ncatastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the \"billions of \\ndollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, \\nthe Maldive Islands and Malaysia,\" said Prudential Equity Group insurance \\nanalyst Jay Gelb. \"US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no \\nexposure. It\\'s more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] \\nmight have some exposure,\" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG \\nEdwards & Co. \\n \\nMany of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the \\nMaldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said \\na US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the \\namount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri \\nLanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to \\nthe cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch. \\n \\nMitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in \\n1998. But the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is \\nincalculable. \"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the \\nnameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped \\nout. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,\" said Jan Egeland, \\nhead of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \\nTourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a \\nfinancial impact too. The Association of British insurers warned that \\ntravel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. It said \\nloss of possessions will usually be covered, but the Association stressed \\nthe importance of checking the wording of travel policies. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDollar hits new low versus euro \\n \\nThe US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to \\na new low against the euro. \\n \\nInvestors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do \\nanything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a \\ndeclining dollar. The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit \\nand analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a \\ndepreciation of the dollar. They have predicted that the dollar is likely \\nto fall even further. \\n \\nThe US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday. \\nThis compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in New York on \\nFriday, which was then a record low. \\n \\nThe dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about \\n$1.20 against the euro. It has lost 7% this year, while against the \\nJapanese yen it is down 3.2%. Traders said that thin trading levels had \\namplified Monday\\'s move. \"It\\'s not going to take much to push [the \\ndollar] one way or the other,\" said Grant Wilson of Mellon Bank. \\nLiquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the \\nmarket - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nIsraeli economy picking up pace \\n \\nIsrael\\'s economy is forecast to grow by 4.2% in 2004 as it continues to \\nemerge from a three-year recession. \\n \\nThe main driver of the faster-than-expected expansion has been exports, \\nwith tourism seeing a strong rebound, the statistical office said. The \\neconomy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli \\nviolence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products. The \\noutlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said. \\n \\nMany companies have focused on cost cutting and greater efficiency, while \\nthe government has been trying to trim public spending and push through \\nreforms. The growth figures come about despite a strike earlier this year \\nby about 400,000 public sector worker which closed banks, hospitals, \\npostal services and transport facilities. Growth did slow in the second \\nhalf, but only slightly. Exports for the year rose by 14%, while tourist \\nrevenues were up by 30%.

In 2003, \\nthe economy expanded by 1.3% \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS gives foreign firms extra time \\n \\nForeign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate \\ngovernance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog. \\n \\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get \\nin line with the rules until 15 July 2006. Many foreign firms had \\nprotested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are \\nthe result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after \\ncorporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox \\nAct, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that \\ntheir financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already \\nhave to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms \\nwhich list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the \\nmiddle of this year. \\n \\nOver the past few months, delegations of European and other business \\nleaders have been heading to the SEC\\'s Washington DC headquarters to \\nprotest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short \\nand some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose \\nto let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. \\nThe latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just \\nbefore the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this \\nsignifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby \\nJones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and \\nto many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation \\nreally means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC \\nsaid it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were \\nalready working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their \\nhome countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new \\ninternational financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t \\nunderestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension \\nwill provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look \\nat their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief \\naccountant. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman jobless rate at new record \\n \\nMore than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures \\nshow. \\n \\nThe figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age \\npopulation, is the highest jobless rate in Europe\\'s biggest economy since \\nthe 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany\\'s panel of government \\neconomic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on \\nGerman TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel\\'s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too \\noptimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005. \\n \\nThe German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of \\njoblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \\n\"Hartz-IV\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits \\nand push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily \\nsubsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the \\npressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day \\nin advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor \\nGerhard Schroeder\\'s Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr \\nSchroeder had originally come into office promising to halve \\nunemployment. \\n \\nStill, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The \\nsoaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology \\nwhich pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. \\nAdjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 \\nmillion people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous \\nmonth. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the \\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people \\nout of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 \\nnew net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people \\nemployed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone \\nwho in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could \\ntake up immediately. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nRecord year for Chilean copper \\n \\nChile\\'s copper industry has registered record earnings of $14.2bn in \\n2004, the governmental Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) has reported. \\n \\nStrong demand from China\\'s fast-growing economy and high prices have \\nfuelled production, said Cochilco vice president Patricio Cartagena. He \\nadded that the boom has allowed the government to collect $950m in taxes. \\nMr Cartagena said the industry expects to see investment worth $10bn over \\nthe next three years. \\n \\n\"With these investments, clearly we are going to continue being the \\nprinciple actor in the mining of copper. It\\'s a consolidation of the \\nindustry with new projects and expansions that will support greater \\nproduction.\" Australia\\'s BHP Billiton - which operates La Escondida, the \\nworld\\'s largest open pit copper mine - is planning to invest $1.9bn \\nbetween now and 2007, while state-owned Codelco will spend about $1bn on \\nvarious projects. Chile, the biggest copper producer in the world, is now \\nanalyzing ways of to keep prices stable at their current high levels, \\nwithout killing off demand or leading customers to look for substitutes \\nfor copper. The copper price reached a 16-year high in October 2004. \\nProduction in Chile is expected rise 3.5% in 2005 to 5.5 million tonnes, \\nsaid Mr Cartagena. Cochilco expects for 2005 a slight reduction on copper \\nprices and forecasts export earnings will fall 10.7%. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS consumer confidence up \\n \\nConsumers\\' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest \\nfor five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey \\nsays. \\n \\nThe feel-good factor among US consumers rose in December for the first \\ntime since July according to new data. The Conference Board survey of \\n5,000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and \\neconomic growth. US retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 \\ndays after a slow start to the crucial festive season. \\n \\nAccording to figures also released on Tuesday, sales in shopping malls in \\nthe week to 25 December were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last \\nminute rush. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December \\nsales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of \\nstrong post-Christmas sales. \\n \\nIt is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month. \\nConsumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator \\nbecause consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic \\nactivity in the United States. \"The continuing economic expansion, \\ncombined with job growth, has consumers ending this year on a high note,\" \\nsaid Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board\\'s consumer research \\ncentre. \"And consumers\\' outlook suggests that the economy will continue \\nto expand in the first half of next year.\" The overall US economy has \\nperformed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to \\nincrease interest rates five times since June. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nCash gives way to flexible friend \\n \\nSpending on credit and debit cards has overtaken cash spending in the UK \\nfor the first time. \\n \\nThe moment that plastic finally toppled cash happened at 10.38am on \\nWednesday, according to the Association for Payment Clearing Services \\n(Apacs) Apacs chose school teacher Helen Carroll, from Portsmouth, to \\nmake the historic transaction. The switch over took place as she paid for \\nher groceries in the supermarket chain Tesco\\'s Cromwell Road branch. \\n \\nMrs Carroll was born in the same year that plastic cards first appeared \\nin the UK. \"I pay for most things with my debit card, with occasional \\npurchases on one of my credit cards,\" said Mrs Carroll, who teaches at \\nPeel Common Infants School in Gosport. \\n \\nSpending patterns for the year and estimates for December led Apacs to \\nconclude that 10.38am was the time that plastic would finally rule the \\nroost. Shoppers in the UK are expected to put Â£269bn on plastic cards \\nduring the whole of 2004, compared with Â£268bn paid with cash, Apacs \\nsaid. When the first plastic cards appeared in the UK in June 1966, \\nissued by Barclaycard, but only a handful of retailers accepted them and \\nvery few customers held them. \"But in less than 40 years, plastic has \\nbecome our most popular way to pay, due to the added security and \\nflexibility it offers,\" said Apacs spokeswoman Jemma Smith. \"The key \\ndriver has been the introduction of debit cards, which now account for \\ntwo-thirds of plastic card transactions and are used by millions of us \\nevery day.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nJapanese mogul arrested for fraud \\n \\nOne of Japan\\'s best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges \\nof falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the \\nfalse data. \\n \\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world\\'s richest man and ran a \\nbusiness spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His \\nis the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over \\nbusiness scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince \\nhotels in Tokyo. \\n \\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large \\nproperty business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s \\nmost powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the \\ncountry\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring \\nthe Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced \\nto resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being \\naccused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, \\none of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed \\ncompany can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr \\nTsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence \\nbecause he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than \\nthis amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, \\nits share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid. \\n \\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top \\nexecutives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business \\npractices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His \\ndetermination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in \\nhis childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his \\nmoney buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has \\ndescribed the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I \\ndined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly \\nmagazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told \\nme fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, \\nsaying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at \\nsome other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from \\nMitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their \\nvehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged \\nwith concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil rebounds from weather effect \\n \\nOil prices recovered in Asian trade on Tuesday, after falling in New York \\non milder winter weather across the US. \\n \\nWith winter temperatures staying relatively high in the northern US, a \\nbarrel of light crude ended Monday down $1.33 to $42.12. However crude \\nprices have rebounded in Asia, rising to $42.30 a barrel for February \\ndelivery. In London, trading of Brent crude was suspended for a public \\nholiday, but the price fell to $39.20 in the Far East. \\n \\nWith milder temperatures expected to continue in the northern parts of \\nthe US over the next few days at least, analysts have said the price of \\noil may fall further - even if the decline was only temporary. \"Weather \\nhas been the Achilles\\' heel of this market,\" said ABN AMRO analyst John \\nBrady. \"But it is winter in the northeast. Eventually we\\'ll get another \\ncold blast.\" Despite a fall of more than $12 a barrel from the record \\nhighs reached in late October, the price of crude oil remains almost 30% \\nhigher than year-ago levels. Prices rose last week after militant attacks \\nin Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, briefly renewed fears that the \\nsupply chain might be broken in the world\\'s leading crude exporter. \"The \\nmarket was panicked but fears essentially evaporated... since there was \\nno follow-up,\" said Deborah White, senior economist for energy at SG \\nSecurities in Paris. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak end-of-year sales hit Next \\n \\nNext has said its annual profit will be Â£5m lower than previously \\nexpected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. \\n \\n\"Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our \\nexpectations,\" the company said. The High Street retailer said it now \\nexpected to report annual profits of between Â£415m and Â£425m ($779m-\\n798m). Next\\'s shares fell more than 3% following the release of the \\ntrading statement. \\n \\nNext chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were \\n\"below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be\", but said sales \\nshould still top analyst expectations. \\n \\nAmong areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear \\nranges were \"a little bit too similar to the previous year\". Mr Wolfson \\nalso said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were \"more to do with \\nthe fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) \\ndemand wasn\\'t there for the stock\". Next\\'s like-for-like store sales in \\nthe five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year \\nearlier. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected \\nby new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next \\nstores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was \\n0.5%. \\n \\nOverall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up \\n12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise \\n13.4% during the five-month period. \"In terms of all the worries about \\ntheir trading pre-Christmas, it\\'s a result,\" said Nick Bubb, an analyst \\nat Evolution Securities. \"Profits of around Â£420m would be well within \\nthe comfort zone.\" However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told \\nReuters the seasonal sales performance was \"not what people had hoped \\nfor\". \"Christmas has been tough for the whole sector, and this is one of \\nthe best retailers,\" he said. Next\\'s trading statement comes a day after \\nHouse of Fraser and Woolworths disappointed investors with their figures. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nTate & Lyle boss bags top award \\n \\nTate & Lyle\\'s chief executive has been named European Businessman of the \\nYear by a leading business magazine. \\n \\nIain Ferguson was awarded the title by US publication Forbes for \\nreturning one of the UK\\'s \"venerable\" manufacturers to the country\\'s top \\n100 companies. The sugar group had been absent from the FTSE 100 for \\nseven years until Mr Ferguson helped it return to growth. Tate\\'s shares \\nhave leapt 55% this year, boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of \\nits artificial sweeteners. \\n \\n\"After years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the \\nFTSE 100, one of Britain\\'s venerable manufacturers has returned to the \\nvaunted index,\" Forbes said. Mr Ferguson took the helm at the company in \\n2003, after spending most of his career at consumer goods giant Unilever. \\nTate & Lyle, which was an original member of the historic FT-30 index in \\n1935, operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production \\nfacilities in 28 countries. Previous winners of the Forbes award include \\nRoyal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin and former Vodafone \\nboss Chris Gent. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nDeutsche Boerse set to \\'woo\\' LSE \\n \\nBosses of Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange are to meet amid \\ntalk that a takeover bid for the LSE will be raised to Â£1.5bn ($2.9bn). \\n \\nLast month, the German exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for \\nLSE, valuing it at Â£1.3bn. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in \\nLondon, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is \\ndue to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to \\nraise Â£1.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is \\nscheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche \\nBoerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third \\nmeeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December. \\n \\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse\\'s proposed Â£1.3bn offer in December, \\nsaying it undervalued the business. \\n \\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \\n\"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s \\nshareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the \\nParis, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the \\nLSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be \\nsolely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage \\nthat any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the \\nbiggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the \\nworld after the New York Stock Exchange. \\n \\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a \\ncharm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German \\nsuitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of \\nLondon and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the \\nDeutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based \\nClearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities \\ntransactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling \\nblock to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche \\nBoerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult \\nfor them to negotiate for lower transaction fees. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nHigh fuel prices hit BA\\'s profits \\n \\nBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. \\n \\nReporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the \\nairline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a \\nyear earlier. Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \\n\"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. \\nBA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it \\nexpects a rise in full-year revenues. \\n \\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year \\nintroduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. \\n \\nIn October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul \\nflights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a \\nleg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein \\nsays BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be \\nway short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. \\nTurnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from \\na rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March \\n2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were \\nexpected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of \\ncompetition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be \\nbetter than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total \\nrevenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to \\n3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had \\npreviously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. \\n \\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. \\nAviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest \\nquarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue \\nside and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo \\ndevelopment, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are \\nvery strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United \\nStates, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \\n\"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst \\ncontinuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, \\nwe have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will \\nstart further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares \\nclosed up four pence at 274.5 pence. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS interest rate rise expected \\n \\nUS interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June \\nfollowing the US Federal Reserve\\'s latest rate-setting meeting later on \\nTuesday. \\n \\nBorrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to \\n2.25%. The move comes as a recovery in the US economy, the world\\'s \\nbiggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. The dollar\\'s \\nrecord-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with \\nhigh oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. \"We are \\nseeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,\" said Ken Kim, an \\nanalyst at Stone & McCarthy Research. \"It\\'s not a risk, it\\'s actually \\nhappening.\" Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further. \\n \\nThe Fed has said that it will move in a \"measured\" way to combat price \\ngrowth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted \\nby sluggish US and global growth. \\n \\nWith the economic picture now looking more rosy, the Fed has implemented \\nquarter percentage point rises in June, August, September and November. \\nAlthough the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three \\nmonths to September, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move \\ntoo aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery\\'s sails. Earlier \\nthis month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer \\nconfidence is subdued. \"I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of \\nflexibility,\" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. \"While \\ninflation has moved up, it hasn\\'t moved up a lot.\" \"If economic growth \\nshould subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in \\nits tightening. \"But if economic growth picked up and caused core \\ninflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be \\nprepared to tighten more quickly as well.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nWeak dollar trims Cadbury profits \\n \\nThe world\\'s biggest confectionery firm, Cadbury Schweppes, has reported a \\nmodest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its \\nresults. \\n \\nUnderlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to Â£933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would \\nhave been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. The owner of \\nbrands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% \\nof its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit \\nits targets for 2005. \"While the external commercial environment remains \\ncompetitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and \\npeople to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,\" said chief executive \\nTodd Stitzer. \\n \\nThe modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company \\nsaid in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in \\nEurope. \\n \\nCadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was \\nhelped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls \\n- which enjoyed a \"successful\" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. \\nDrinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, \\nled by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. \\nCadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved \\nÂ£75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to Â£100m since the scheme \\nbegan in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group\\'s \\nfactories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more \\nthan 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nContinental \\'may run out of cash\\' \\n \\nShares in Continental Airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it \\ncould run out of cash. \\n \\nIn a filing to US regulators the airline warned of \"inadequate liquidity\" \\nif it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. \\nContinental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to \\nlose \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in 2005 in current market \\nconditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its \\nfleet, the group said. Shares in the fifth biggest US carrier had fallen \\n6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. \"Without the reduction in wage \\nand benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we \\nbelieve that our ability to raise additional money through financings \\nwould be uncertain,\" Continental said in its filing to the US Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (SEC). \\n \\nAirlines have faced tough conditions in recent years, amid terrorism \\nfears since the 11 September World Trade Centre attack in 2001. But \\ndespite passengers returning to the skies, record-high fuel costs and \\nfare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their \\ntoll. Houston-based Continental now has debt and pension payments of \\nnearly $984m which it must pay off this year. The company has been \\nworking to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in \\ncosts without cutting jobs. Two weeks\\' ago the group also announced it \\nwould be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes \\nto wage and benefits for most of its US-based management and clerical \\nstaff. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nMixed Christmas for US retailers \\n \\nUS retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers \\nfaring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales. \\n \\nUpscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher \\nthan during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold \\nwell, with sales jumping 28% at young women\\'s clothing retailer Bebe \\nStores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its \\nsales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December \\nsales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier. \\n \\nCustomers at the world\\'s biggest retailer are generally seen to be the \\nmost vulnerable to America\\'s economic woes. \\n \\nCommentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over \\njob security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in \\nspending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart \\nfaced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the \\nfestive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best \\nbargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across \\nthe sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual \\nretail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better \\nthan expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst \\nat research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that \\nhave been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be \\ncontinuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the \\nlast several months, December was a good month.\" Overall, December sales \\nare forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen \\na year earlier. \\n \\nOne discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, \\nwhich continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-\\nexpected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and \\nvaried. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales \\nsink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. \\nLeading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of \\na 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas \\nperiod. Accessory vendor Claire\\'s Stores also suffered as an expected \\nlast minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store \\nsales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt \\nlittle Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month \\nlast year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw \\na dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry \\nforecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the \\ndesertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According \\nto a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net \\nRatings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSteady job growth continues in US \\n \\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said \\nthat the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world\\'s biggest \\neconomy. \\n \\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last \\nmonth. That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five \\nyears. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US \\neconomy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady \\ngrowth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in \\nDecember, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if \\nthat figure is to drop. \\n \\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa \\nSecurities. \\n \\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus \\nforecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an \\nincrease in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area \\nof the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication \\nthat the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal \\nReserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The \\nFed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence \\nthe US economic recovery was becoming more robust. \\n \\nJob creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and \\nproved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. \\nWhile demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for \\nsteady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it \\njust keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" \\nin 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, \\neconomists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal \\nReserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A \\nfall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US \\neconomic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest \\nrate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a \\nfall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, \\nwhile noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nBarclays shares up on merger talk \\n \\nShares in UK banking group Barclays have risen on Monday following a \\nweekend press report that it had held merger talks with US bank Wells \\nFargo. \\n \\nA tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create \\nthe world\\'s fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn (Â£96bn). Barclays has \\ndeclined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does \\nnot respond to market speculation. The two banks reportedly held talks in \\nOctober and November 2004. \\n \\nBarclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in \\nLondon on Monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 \\nindex. UK banking icon Barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it \\nhas operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. \\nIts North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells \\nFargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. \\nIn 2003, Barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£3.8bn, and \\nit has recently forecast similar gains in 2004, predicting that full year \\npre-tax profits would rise 18% to Â£4.5bn. Wells Fargo had net income of \\n$6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, \\nand revenues of $28.4bn. Barclays was the focus of takeover speculation \\nin August, when it was linked to Citigroup, though no bid has ever \\nmaterialised. Stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports \\nheralded a deal. \"The chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he \\ndidn\\'t talk to rivals, but a deal doesn\\'t seem likely,\" Reuters quoted \\none trader as saying. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUK Coal plunges into deeper loss \\n \\nShares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had \\ndeepened to Â£51.6m in 2004 from Â£1.2m. \\n \\nThe UK\\'s biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial \\naction and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening \\nfortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry \\nSpindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on \\nThursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was \\nmaking \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had \\nintroduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for \\nmachinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse \\nconditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift \\nearnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to \\nprofitability in 2006. \\n \\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most \\nof its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were \\nÂ£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was \\njust Â£1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these \\nissues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been \\nmade,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines \\nacross Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West \\nMidlands, Northumberland and Durham. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nChinese exports rise 25% in 2004 \\n \\nExports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the \\ncountry continued to show breakneck growth. \\n \\nThe spurt put China\\'s trade surplus - a sore point with some of its \\ntrading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on \\nChina to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening \\ndollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China\\'s \\ntax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year \\nin a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a \\ntightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid \\nexpansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan \\n($311bn; Â£165bn). \\n \\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China\\'s exports totalled $63.8bn \\nin December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports \\nrising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax \\ntake comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn \\nyuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China\\'s exporting success has made the \\ntrade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with \\nChina a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan \\naround 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses \\nat home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-\\nmandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and \\n2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said \\nthe report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, \\nmoving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. \\nThe US\\'s overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is \\nexpected to rise to about $150bn for 2004. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nKarachi stocks hit historic high \\n \\nThe Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day \\ngain, surging 3.5% to a new high. \\n \\nThe index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many \\ninvestors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic \\nboom. The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 \\npoints in the first two trading days of the week. Energy and \\ntelecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% \\nrise since Monday morning. \\n \\nIn 2002, the KSE was the world\\'s best performing stock market, with the \\nindex rising 112%. \\n \\nPakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, \\nits 2002 performance. Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the \\nmarket closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will \\ncontinue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, \\nhowever, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of \\nprices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any \\ntime\". \"That\\'s rubbish,\" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News \\nwebsite. \"Whenever the market reflects Pakistan\\'s true economic reality, \\nit is described as a bubble.\" Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen \\non the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on \\nsound foundations. \\n \\nMarket analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there \\nare a number of major factors behind the KSE\\'s performance. Analysts \\nargue that a steady improvement in Pakistan\\'s credit ratings by \\ninternational credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the \\nmarket. Standard & Poor\\'s upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. There are \\nindications of yet another upgrade by the end of February. \\n \\nThen, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current \\nfiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"Coupled with the \\n7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the \\nmarket\\'s performance,\" says Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said \\nthe real reasons may be political. \"If you file a $1.3 trillion case \\nagainst Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any \\nmore.\" A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and \\nIndonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the \\nstrongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE. \\n \\nLocally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to \\nthe market\\'s advantage. \\n \\nAn anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance \\nof religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, \\nformer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto\\'s husband, has eased political \\ntensions between the military-backed government and the opposition \\nPakistan People\\'s Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of \\ntalks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-\\nadministered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. \\nThis, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising \\nthe temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their \\ndisagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial \\ninvestment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally \\nas deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian \\nneighbours. \"You can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"Let \\nus see how long one can reap its benefits.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS trade gap ballooned in October \\n \\nThe US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October, hitting \\nrecord levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have \\nshown \\n \\nThe trade shortfall was $55.5bn (Â£29bn), up 9% from September, the \\nCommerce Department said. That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. \\nImports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker \\ndollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive \\nexport demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that\\'s to \\nbe expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor\\'s in New York. \"The \\nfirst thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of \\nimports. \"We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going \\nin the right direction.\" \\n \\nDespite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the US will \\nfund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. Another \\nproblem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, \\nwhich has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order \\nto boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China \\nduring October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry \\nthat has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony \\nCrescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade \\ndeficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The \\nCommerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite \\nwidespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest \\nrates for a fifth time this year. Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a \\nquarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a Fed meeting later on Tuesday. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nSaudi ministry to employ women \\n \\nWomen will be employed in Saudi Arabia\\'s foreign ministry for the first \\ntime this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported \\nas saying. \\n \\nThe move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to \\nworking women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told \\ngovernment departments to put plans in place for employing women. But \\nprogress has been slow, reports from the country say. \\n \\nEarlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-\\nGosaibi had \"caused uproar\" when he said his ministry was having \\ndifficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The \\nnewspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \"a pitiful excuse \\nfor not employing women\". Women now make up more than half of all \\ngraduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. \"Our \\neducational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and \\nprofessionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful \\nposition in Saudi society,\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. \"I am \\nproud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the \\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\" \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS prepares for hybrid onslaught \\n \\nSales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research \\nsuggests. \\n \\nResearch group JD Power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite \\nhigher prices and customer scepticism. Carmakers are starting to build \\nhybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles \\nwhich now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption \\nand emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor \\nconstantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, \\nnotably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. \\nEqually, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that \\nconsumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a \\nyear on fuel. \\n \\nAt the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently \\ndisplaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date \\nwith the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish \\ntheir \"green\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of \\nits Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in \\nthe year. \\n \\nHonda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese \\ncarmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold \\n4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a \\nhybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans \\nfor three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and \\nis showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may \\njoin the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to \\nhybridise its Cayenne SUV. \\n \\nOthers remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota\\'s hybrid \\ntechnology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"We want \\nto make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" Nissan chief \\nexecutive Carlos Ghosn said. \"We will not be surprised by any \\nacceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" Volkswagen, \\nmeanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. \\nAnd some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of \\n$3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of \\nthe technology - may still cool its attraction. \"The average consumers \\naren\\'t willing to pay that premium for a car they won\\'t drive more than \\nsix years,\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nOil prices fall back from highs \\n \\nOil prices retreated from four-month highs in early trading on Tuesday \\nafter producers\\' cartel Opec said it was now unlikely to cut production. \\n \\nFollowing the comments by acting Opec secretary general Adnan Shihab-\\nEldin, US light crude fell 32 cents to $51.43 a barrel. He said that high \\noil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in \\nthe second quarter. In London, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a \\nbarrel. \\n \\nOpec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 March. \\nOn Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-\\nmonth high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil. US \\ndemand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this \\nweek, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year \\nago. Cold weather across Europe has also put upward pressure on crude \\nprices. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nGerman economy rebounds \\n \\nGermany\\'s economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, \\ngrew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong \\nexports. \\n \\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical \\noffice said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by \\n8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. \\nConcerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic \\ndemand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left \\nits benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the \\nnineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. \\nEconomists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second \\nhalf of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite. \\n \\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was \\nstrong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If \\nexports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much \\nfrom 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by \\ngovernment attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate \\nenvironment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and \\nSiemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming \\njobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting \\nmeasures on the horizon. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS Ahold suppliers face charges \\n \\nUS prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch \\nretailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (Â£428m). \\n \\nThe charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies, \\nalleging they created false accounts. Ahold hit the headlines in February \\n2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US \\nsubsidiary Foodservice. Three former Ahold top executives last year \\nagreed to settle fraud charges. \\n \\nAhold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances \\nat Foodservice, improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed \\nother accounting errors and irregularities. \\n \\nThe nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of \\nsigning false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the \\nretailer for promoting their products in its stores. Food companies pay \\nsupermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. The suppliers in \\nquestion are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, \\nproviding auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its \\nearnings. US Attorney David Kelley said he expects the nine vendors will \\nplead guilty to the charges. He added that there may be more court \\nactions in the future. \"I don\\'t want to leave you with the impression \\nthat these were the only ones involved,\" he said. Among those facing \\ncharges are John Nettle, a former employee of General Mills; Mark Bailin \\nof Rymer International Seafood; Tim Daly of Michael Foods and Kenneth \\nBowman, who worked as an independent contractor for Total Foods. \\n \\nOthers include Michael Hannigan of Sugar Foods; Peter Marion of Maritime \\nSeafood Processors and First Choice Foods; Gordon Redgate of Commodity \\nManager and Private Label Distribution; Bruce Robinson of Basic American \\nFoods and Michael Rogers, formerly of Tyson Foods. Pasquale D\\'Amuro of \\nthe FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in \"the process of \\ncooking the books\" at Ahold. At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen \\nby many as Europe\\'s Enron. Ahold shares tumbled on the news and many \\nmarket observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor \\nconfidence across Europe. It was less severe than many had envisaged, \\nhowever, and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its \\nreputation and investor confidence. Ahold is the world\\'s fourth-largest \\nsupermarket chain. Its other US businesses include Stop & Shop, and Giant \\nFood. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\nUS retail sales surge in December \\n \\nUS retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in \\nDecember, boosted by strong car sales. \\n \\nSeasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month, compared to 0.1% a \\nmonth earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after \\nChristmas. Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an \\n8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a \\n4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out \\nof showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain \\nsales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales \\nboom was slow to get started. \\n \\nThe increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month \\nto $349.4bn (Â£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 \\ntrillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 \\ntrillion However, if automotives are excluded from December\\'s data, \\nretail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. Home furnishings and furniture \\nstores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the \\nshops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their \\npurchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, \\nanalysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal \\nReserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. \\n\"Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US \\nexpansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue \\nboosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,\" UBS economist Maury \\nHarris told Reuters. \\n \\nRetail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in \\nturn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending \\nhas been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 \\nas the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade \\nand the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a \\nlacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts \\nnow expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street \\nwith consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the \\nlatest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. \\nThe number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, \\nthe highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to \\ntheir lowest level since 2001. \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------- \\n', 1.9670004)\n"
